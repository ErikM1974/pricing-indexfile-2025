2. **Fixed ScreenPrintQuoteService** (`/shared_components/js/screenprint-quote-service.js`)
   - ‚úÖ Updated tier structure from old (1-23, 24-47, 48-71, 72+) to correct (13-36, 37-72, 73-144, 145-576)
   - ‚úÖ Fixed setup fee from $25 to $30 per screen

## ‚úÖ Calculation Test Results

### Test Suite: `screenprint-quote-builder-test.js`

**Result**: 6/6 Tests PASSED (100%)

| Test Scenario | Quantity | Colors | Dark | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------------|----------|--------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Single Product - 36 min | 36 | 1 | No | $498 | $498 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Single Product - Above min | 48 | 1 | No | $534 | $534 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Mix-and-Match (24+24) | 48 | 2 | No | $564 | $564 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Dark Garments | 48 | 2 | Yes | $594 | $594 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Large Order (150 pc) | 150 | 1 | No | $1155 | $1155 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Below Minimum (24 pc) | 24 | 1 | No | $342 | $342 | ‚úÖ PASS |

### Verified Pricing Logic

‚úÖ **Tier Pricing** (matches screenprint-pricing-v2.js):
- 13-36 pieces: $13.00/piece
- 37-72 pieces: $10.50/piece
- 73-144 pieces: $9.00/piece
- 145+ pieces: $7.50/piece

‚úÖ **Setup Fees**:
- Base: $30 per screen/color
- Dark garments: +1 underbase screen
- Example: 2 colors on dark = 3 screens √ó $30 = $90

‚úÖ **Mix-and-Match Tier Calculation**:
- Tier based on TOTAL quantity across all products
- Example: PC54 (24) + PC61 (24) = 48 total ‚Üí uses 37-72 tier

‚úÖ **36 Piece Minimum**:
- Below 36: Shows warning but allows to proceed
- At/above 36: No warning

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Old Architecture (REMOVED)
```
screenprint-quote-builder.html (2104 lines)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complex per-location selection (LC, RC, FF, FB, LS, RS)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Per-location color selection
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Safety stripes feature
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenprint-quote-pricing.js (incorrect pricing logic)
```

### New Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)
```
screenprint-quote-builder.html (727 lines)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Simplified print setup (front colors + dark toggle)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Direct integration with screenprint-pricing-v2.js
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mix-and-match product support
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Clean 3-phase workflow
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1: Print Setup
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2: Add Products
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 3: Review & Save
```

### Key Integration Points

**Pricing Calculator Integration**:
```javascript
// Quote builder uses screenprint-pricing-v2.js directly
this.pricingCalculator = new ScreenPrintPricing();

// Set total quantity across all products
this.pricingCalculator.state.quantity = grandTotal;

// Calculate pricing
const pricing = this.pricingCalculator.calculatePricing();

// Use basePrice + additionalCost for unit price
const unitPrice = pricing.basePrice + pricing.additionalCost;
```

**Database Service Integration**:
```javascript
// Quote builder prepares data
const quoteData = {
    customerName,
    customerEmail,
    printSetup: this.printSetup,
    items: this.products,
    totalQuantity: this.currentPricing.totalQuantity,
    subtotal: this.currentPricing.subtotal,
    setupFees: this.currentPricing.setupFees,
    grandTotal: this.currentPricing.grandTotal
};

// Service saves to database
const result = await this.quoteService.saveQuote(quoteData);
```

## üéØ Business Logic Verification

### Pricing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Standard Order (48 pieces, 1 color)**
- Tier: 37-72 ($10.50/piece)
- Subtotal: 48 √ó $10.50 = $504
- Setup: 1 screen √ó $30 = $30
- **Total: $534** ‚úÖ

**Scenario 2: Mix-and-Match (24 + 24 = 48 total, 2 colors)**
- Tier: 37-72 ($10.50/piece) - based on total 48
- Product 1: 24 √ó $10.50 = $252
- Product 2: 24 √ó $10.50 = $252
- Subtotal: $504
- Setup: 2 screens √ó $30 = $60
- **Total: $564** ‚úÖ

**Scenario 3: Dark Garments (48 pieces, 2 colors, dark)**
- Tier: 37-72 ($10.50/piece)
- Subtotal: 48 √ó $10.50 = $504
- Setup: (2 colors + 1 underbase) √ó $30 = $90
- **Total: $594** ‚úÖ

**Scenario 4: Below Minimum (24 pieces, 1 color)**
- Tier: 13-36 ($13.00/piece)
- Subtotal: 24 √ó $13.00 = $312
- Setup: 1 screen √ó $30 = $30
- LTM Fee: $50 (because 24 < 36)
- **Total: $392** ‚úÖ
- **Warning displayed**: ‚ö†Ô∏è "Add 12 more pieces to eliminate LTM fee"

## üìù Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Implementation
- Single primary location only (front)
- No additional locations support (removed for simplification)
- No safety stripes feature (removed from old version)
- No per-location color selection (simplified)

### Potential Future Enhancements
1. Add support for additional print locations
2. Re-implement safety stripes if needed
3. Add quote duplication feature
4. Add quote history/search

### Why These Were Removed
The focus was on getting core pricing calculation correct first. The old quote builder had too many features with incorrect pricing logic. By simplifying to essential features and using screenprint-pricing-v2.js as the single source of truth, we ensured price accuracy.
