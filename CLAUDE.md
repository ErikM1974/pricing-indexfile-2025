### Core Files (Root Directory)
The following files remain in the root directory as they are core to the application:
- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `product.html` - Product display page
- `cart.html` - Shopping cart
- `server.js` - Node.js Express server
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- Configuration files

## High-Level Architecture

### Master Bundle Pattern
The system uses a "Master Bundle" approach where Caspio sends comprehensive pricing data that's managed client-side:

1. **Caspio Backend** ‚Üí Calculates ALL price permutations for a decoration type
2. **PostMessage Communication** ‚Üí Sends master bundle to adapter via iframe
3. **Adapters** (e.g., `DTGAdapter.js`) ‚Üí Store bundle and extract relevant pricing based on user selections
4. **Event System** ‚Üí Adapters dispatch `pricingDataLoaded` events
5. **UI Components** ‚Üí Listen for events and update pricing displays

### Key Architectural Components

1. **Adapters** (`/shared_components/js/*-adapter.js`)
   - Each decoration type has its own adapter
   - Handles master bundle storage and data extraction
   - Dispatches standardized events

2. **Quote System** 
   - Two-table database structure: `quote_sessions` + `quote_items`
   - Quote IDs follow pattern: `[PREFIX][MMDD]-[sequence]`
   - Database operations via Heroku proxy API

3. **Cart Management** (`shared_components/js/cart.js`)
   - Local and server-side session management
   - Enforces business rules (single embellishment type per cart)
   - Real-time price recalculation

4. **API Proxy** (`server.js` ‚Üí Heroku)
   - Base URL: `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com`
   - Handles all Caspio database operations
   - Modular route structure in `/src/routes/`

## API Documentation - Single Source of Truth with Inter-Claude Communication

### Caspio Pricing Proxy API
@memory/CASPIO_API_TEMPLATE.md
- **SHARED DOCUMENTATION** between this app and caspio-pricing-proxy server
- Complete documentation for all 53 active API endpoints
- **INTER-CLAUDE COMMUNICATION LOG** for coordination with API Provider
- Enhanced product search with faceted filtering
- Cart management (sessions, items, sizes)
- Pricing calculations for all decoration methods
- Order processing and dashboard metrics with CSR performance
- Art requests and invoicing with full CRUD
- Quote system (critical for calculators)
- Transfer pricing and inventory management
- Production schedules

**API Base URL**: `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api`

### üîî Session Start Protocol
**IMPORTANT: At the start of each session, you MUST:**
1. Read @memory/CASPIO_API_TEMPLATE.md
2. Check the "Active Conversations" section for pending messages from Provider Claude
3. Review "Recent Updates Requiring Acknowledgment" and check off completed items
4. Update your "Last Checked by Consumer" timestamp
5. Respond to any questions or acknowledge updates

### üí¨ Communicating with API Provider Claude

**When you need to communicate with the API Provider:**
1. Add messages to the Communication Log in CASPIO_API_TEMPLATE.md
2. Use appropriate message prefixes:
   - ‚ùì **QUESTION** when you need information about the API
   - üêõ **BUG** when you find an API issue
   - üí° **SUGGESTION** for improvement ideas
   - ü§ù **ACKNOWLEDGED** when you've implemented a change
   - ‚úÖ **ANSWER** when responding to Provider's questions

**Example message format:**
```
**2025-01-30 16:30** - ‚ùì **QUESTION** from API Consumer:
The /api/products/search endpoint returns duplicates when filtering by multiple colors.
Is this intentional or should results be unique by style?
```

### üìù Your Responsibilities as API Consumer
- Report bugs and unexpected behavior
- Document integration patterns you discover
- Request missing functionality
- Provide UI/UX feedback on API responses
- Update "Implementation Notes from Consumer" section with important findings
- Acknowledge breaking changes and update your code accordingly

### üö® When Provider Reports Breaking Changes
1. Check the üö® **BREAKING** messages immediately
2. Review migration guide if provided
3. Update affected code in the application
4. Test thoroughly
5. Acknowledge the change with ü§ù **ACKNOWLEDGED** message
6. Report any issues encountered during migration

**Important**: This shared documentation enables asynchronous communication between you and the API Provider Claude, ensuring both applications stay synchronized without human intervention.

## Claude Development Guidelines

1. First understand the existing patterns by reading relevant files
2. Create a plan in tasks/todo.md before making changes
3. Make minimal, focused changes that impact as little code as possible
4. Follow established patterns (adapters, quote system, event communication)
5. Always verify security - no sensitive data in frontend, validate all inputs
6. Test changes incrementally using browser console

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Routing Requirements for New Pages

**REMINDER: When Claude creates a new page, the following MUST be done to avoid white screen/page not loading errors:**

1. **Add the new page to the route configuration** - The page must be registered in the routing system or it will not load
2. **Ask Erik to restart the local server (port 3000)** - After adding a new page, Erik must restart the server using Roocode for the changes to take effect

**Failure to do these steps will result in:**
- White screen when trying to access the new page
- Page not loading error
- Routes not being recognized

**Always remember:** New page ‚Üí Add to routes ‚Üí Restart server with Erik's help

## üö´ API Error Handling Policy - NO Silent Failures

**ERIK'S REQUIREMENT: Never use fallback/cached data when API connections fail!**

**Why this matters:**
- Using incorrect pricing data is WORSE than showing an error
- Silent failures hide problems that need to be fixed
- Customers could receive wrong quotes if fallback data is outdated

**Implementation Requirements:**

1. **When API calls fail, you MUST:**
   - Display a visible warning/error message on the page
   - Prevent the calculator/tool from proceeding with potentially wrong data
   - Log the error details to the console for debugging

2. **Never do this:**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Silent fallback
   try {
     const data = await fetchAPI();
   } catch (error) {
     const data = getCachedData(); // NO! Don't silently use fallback
   }
   ```

3. **Always do this:**
   ```javascript
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Visible failure
   try {
     const data = await fetchAPI();
   } catch (error) {
     showErrorBanner('Unable to load current pricing. Please refresh or contact support.');
     console.error('API failed:', error);
     throw error; // Stop execution
   }
   ```

**Remember:** It's better to show "Service temporarily unavailable" than to quietly use wrong pricing data!

## Adding New Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Claude does NOT automatically scan the memory/ directory. You MUST update this file when adding new documentation.

### When Adding a New Memory File:

1. **Create your file** in the `memory/` directory (e.g., `memory/NEW_FEATURE_GUIDE.md`)

2. **Update this CLAUDE.md file** by adding a reference in the appropriate section:
   ```markdown
   ### New Feature Guide
   @memory/NEW_FEATURE_GUIDE.md
   - Brief description of what the guide covers
   - Key topics included
   ```

3. **Choose the right section**:
   - Git Workflow Documentation - for Git/deployment guides
   - Development Guides - for implementation/technical guides
   - Active Calculators - for calculator-specific documentation

### Why This Matters

- Claude only knows about files explicitly referenced in CLAUDE.md
- The @memory/ notation tells Claude where to find detailed information
- Without updating CLAUDE.md, your new documentation won't be used

### Example Addition

If you create `memory/SHOPWORKS_INTEGRATION.md`, add to Development Guides:
```markdown
### ShopWorks Integration
@memory/SHOPWORKS_INTEGRATION.md
- How to integrate with ShopWorks system
- API endpoints and data mapping
- Common issues and solutions
```

## Pricing Calculations

### Minimum Fee Calculation
- Less than minimum fee is calculated as a flat $50.00 when the total order value falls below the established minimum order threshold
- This ensures a baseline revenue for small orders that do not meet the standard minimum pricing requirements

## Key Takeaways & Common Issues

### Implementation Standards
1. **Follow Established Patterns**: All calculators use same architecture - HTML page, quote service, EmailJS integration
2. **Database Integration**: Always use two-table structure (quote_sessions + quote_items)
3. **EmailJS Variables**: Provide ALL template variables with defaults to avoid corruption
4. **Quote IDs**: Use unique prefixes and daily sequence reset
5. **Error Handling**: Log details but don't stop email send on database failure
6. **Testing**: Always show quote ID in success message for user reference

### Common Fixes
- **EmailJS "Corrupted variables"**: Add missing variables with defaults (`|| ''`)
- **Database not saving**: Check endpoint `/api/quote_sessions` and field names  
- **Quote ID not showing**: Add display element in success message
- **Wrong template**: Use template ID, not name
- **Script parsing error**: Escape closing tags: `<\/script>`
- **CSS not updating**: Add cache-busting parameter to stylesheet link

### Console Debug Commands
```javascript
// Check calculator initialization
console.log(window.[name]Calculator);

// Test quote ID generation  
console.log(new [Name]QuoteService().generateQuoteID());

// Debug email data
console.log('Email data:', emailData);
```

## Active Calculators

The following calculators are currently active in the system:
- **DTG Contract** (DTG) - Contract pricing for direct-to-garment printing
- **Richardson Caps** (RICH) - Richardson vendor cap pricing
- **Embroidery Contract** (EMB) - Contract embroidery pricing
- **Customer Supplied Embroidery** (EMBC) - Embroidery on customer-supplied garments
- **Laser Tumblers** (LT) - Polar Camel laser engraved tumblers
- **Embroidered Emblems** (PATCH) - Custom patches and badges

Remember: These existing calculators serve as working examples. When in doubt, reference their implementation patterns.
