# Northwest Custom Apparel (NWCA) Pricing System

## Project Overview

The NWCA Pricing System is a comprehensive web application providing dynamic pricing calculators for various decoration methods on apparel and promotional products. It features product catalog browsing, real-time pricing calculations, quote generation with database persistence, and staff management tools.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start          # Start Node.js proxy server (port 3000)
npm run dev        # Run webpack dev server for frontend development
npm run build:dev  # Build for development

# Production
npm run build      # Build for production (minified, optimized)
npm analyze        # Analyze bundle size

# Utility
npm run clean      # Clean dist directory
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Master Bundle Pattern
The system uses a "Master Bundle" approach where Caspio sends comprehensive pricing data that's managed client-side:

1. **Caspio Backend** ‚Üí Calculates ALL price permutations for a decoration type
2. **PostMessage Communication** ‚Üí Sends master bundle to adapter via iframe
3. **Adapters** (e.g., `DTGAdapter.js`) ‚Üí Store bundle and extract relevant pricing based on user selections
4. **Event System** ‚Üí Adapters dispatch `pricingDataLoaded` events
5. **UI Components** ‚Üí Listen for events and update pricing displays

### Key Architectural Components

1. **Adapters** (`/shared_components/js/*-adapter.js`)
   - Each decoration type has its own adapter
   - Handles master bundle storage and data extraction
   - Dispatches standardized events

2. **Quote System** 
   - Two-table database structure: `quote_sessions` + `quote_items`
   - Quote IDs follow pattern: `[PREFIX][MMDD]-[sequence]`
   - Database operations via Heroku proxy API

3. **Cart Management** (`shared_components/js/cart.js`)
   - Local and server-side session management
   - Enforces business rules (single embellishment type per cart)
   - Real-time price recalculation

4. **API Proxy** (`server.js` ‚Üí Heroku)
   - Base URL: `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com`
   - Handles all Caspio database operations
   - Modular route structure in `/src/routes/`

## API Documentation - Single Source of Truth with Inter-Claude Communication

### Caspio Pricing Proxy API
@memory/CASPIO_API_TEMPLATE.md
- **SHARED DOCUMENTATION** between this app and caspio-pricing-proxy server
- Complete documentation for all 53 active API endpoints
- **INTER-CLAUDE COMMUNICATION LOG** for coordination with API Provider
- Enhanced product search with faceted filtering
- Cart management (sessions, items, sizes)
- Pricing calculations for all decoration methods
- Order processing and dashboard metrics with CSR performance
- Art requests and invoicing with full CRUD
- Quote system (critical for calculators)
- Transfer pricing and inventory management
- Production schedules

**API Base URL**: `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api`

### üîî Session Start Protocol
**IMPORTANT: At the start of each session, you MUST:**
1. Read @memory/CASPIO_API_TEMPLATE.md
2. Check the "Active Conversations" section for pending messages from Provider Claude
3. Review "Recent Updates Requiring Acknowledgment" and check off completed items
4. Update your "Last Checked by Consumer" timestamp
5. Respond to any questions or acknowledge updates

### üí¨ Communicating with API Provider Claude

**When you need to communicate with the API Provider:**
1. Add messages to the Communication Log in CASPIO_API_TEMPLATE.md
2. Use appropriate message prefixes:
   - ‚ùì **QUESTION** when you need information about the API
   - üêõ **BUG** when you find an API issue
   - üí° **SUGGESTION** for improvement ideas
   - ü§ù **ACKNOWLEDGED** when you've implemented a change
   - ‚úÖ **ANSWER** when responding to Provider's questions

**Example message format:**
```
**2025-01-30 16:30** - ‚ùì **QUESTION** from API Consumer:
The /api/products/search endpoint returns duplicates when filtering by multiple colors.
Is this intentional or should results be unique by style?
```

### üìù Your Responsibilities as API Consumer
- Report bugs and unexpected behavior
- Document integration patterns you discover
- Request missing functionality
- Provide UI/UX feedback on API responses
- Update "Implementation Notes from Consumer" section with important findings
- Acknowledge breaking changes and update your code accordingly

### üö® When Provider Reports Breaking Changes
1. Check the üö® **BREAKING** messages immediately
2. Review migration guide if provided
3. Update affected code in the application
4. Test thoroughly
5. Acknowledge the change with ü§ù **ACKNOWLEDGED** message
6. Report any issues encountered during migration

**Important**: This shared documentation enables asynchronous communication between you and the API Provider Claude, ensuring both applications stay synchronized without human intervention.

## Claude Development Guidelines

1. First understand the existing patterns by reading relevant files
2. Create a plan in tasks/todo.md before making changes
3. Make minimal, focused changes that impact as little code as possible
4. Follow established patterns (adapters, quote system, event communication)
5. Always verify security - no sensitive data in frontend, validate all inputs
6. Test changes incrementally using browser console

## Adding New Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Claude does NOT automatically scan the memory/ directory. You MUST update this file when adding new documentation.

### When Adding a New Memory File:

1. **Create your file** in the `memory/` directory (e.g., `memory/NEW_FEATURE_GUIDE.md`)

2. **Update this CLAUDE.md file** by adding a reference in the appropriate section:
   ```markdown
   ### New Feature Guide
   @memory/NEW_FEATURE_GUIDE.md
   - Brief description of what the guide covers
   - Key topics included
   ```

3. **Choose the right section**:
   - Git Workflow Documentation - for Git/deployment guides
   - Development Guides - for implementation/technical guides
   - Active Calculators - for calculator-specific documentation

### Why This Matters

- Claude only knows about files explicitly referenced in CLAUDE.md
- The @memory/ notation tells Claude where to find detailed information
- Without updating CLAUDE.md, your new documentation won't be used

### Example Addition

If you create `memory/SHOPWORKS_INTEGRATION.md`, add to Development Guides:
```markdown
### ShopWorks Integration
@memory/SHOPWORKS_INTEGRATION.md
- How to integrate with ShopWorks system
- API endpoints and data mapping
- Common issues and solutions
```

## Pricing Calculations

### Minimum Fee Calculation
- Less than minimum fee is calculated as a flat $50.00 when the total order value falls below the established minimum order threshold
- This ensures a baseline revenue for small orders that do not meet the standard minimum pricing requirements

## Key Takeaways

1. **Follow Established Patterns**: All calculators use the same architecture - HTML page, quote service, EmailJS integration
2. **Database Integration**: Always use the two-table structure (quote_sessions + quote_items)
3. **EmailJS Variables**: Provide ALL template variables with defaults to avoid corruption
4. **Quote IDs**: Use unique prefixes and daily sequence reset
5. **Error Handling**: Log details but don't stop email send on database failure
6. **Testing**: Always show quote ID in success message for user reference

## Active Calculators

The following calculators are currently active in the system:
- **DTG Contract** (DTG) - Contract pricing for direct-to-garment printing
- **Richardson Caps** (RICH) - Richardson vendor cap pricing
- **Embroidery Contract** (EMB) - Contract embroidery pricing
- **Customer Supplied Embroidery** (EMBC) - Embroidery on customer-supplied garments
- **Laser Tumblers** (LT) - Polar Camel laser engraved tumblers
- **Embroidered Emblems** (PATCH) - Custom patches and badges

Remember: These existing calculators serve as working examples. When in doubt, reference their implementation patterns.
