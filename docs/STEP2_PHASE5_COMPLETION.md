## 💡 Key Success Factors

### What Worked Well
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Hiding swatches until needed reduces visual clutter
2. **Design Tokens** - CSS custom properties ensure consistency
3. **Empty States** - Professional empty state sets good first impression
4. **Event-Driven** - Custom events keep components loosely coupled
5. **Documentation** - Multiple docs for different audiences (technical vs. user)

### Design Decisions
1. **Hidden Dropdown** - Color dropdown hidden but functional preserves backend compatibility
2. **SVG Illustration** - Custom SVG for empty state keeps file size small
3. **CSS Grid** - Modern layout with minimal code
4. **Floating Animation** - Subtle motion adds life without being distracting
5. **Testing Guide** - Non-technical guide enables effective user testing
