### Step 2: Test the Form (5 minutes)

4. Verify all fields populated correctly

### Step 4: Check Emails (2 minutes)

**You should receive 2 emails:**

- Look for error messages
- Verify EmailJS templates are created
- Check template IDs match exactly

### "Emails not arriving"
- **Solution**: Check spam folder
- Verify EmailJS dashboard shows sends
- Check template IDs in service file
- Test templates in EmailJS dashboard first

### "Database not saving"
- **Solution**: Check console for API errors
- Verify Caspio proxy is running
- Quote still succeeds if DB fails (email still sends)
