mv archive-2025-cleanup/[filename] .
```

### Next Steps for Further Reduction

Based on this successful cleanup, we can now proceed with:

1. **Phase 2 - Archive Folder Review** (Est. 18,000 lines)
   - Review `/archive/` folder contents
   - Move truly obsolete files

2. **Phase 3 - Duplicate JS Files** (Est. 30,000 lines)
   - Consolidate duplicate pricing adapters
   - Remove versioned JS files (v1, v2, v3)

3. **Phase 4 - Extract Inline Code** (Est. 40,000 lines)
   - Extract inline CSS from 273 HTML files
   - Extract inline JavaScript from 259 HTML files

### Current Status
✅ **Website fully functional**
✅ **No broken links**
✅ **All active pages working**
✅ **25,000 lines safely archived**

### Recommendation
Wait 24-48 hours to ensure no issues arise. If everything continues working normally, the `archive-2025-cleanup/` folder can be:
1. Zipped for long-term storage
2. Moved to external backup
3. Eventually deleted after confirming no issues
