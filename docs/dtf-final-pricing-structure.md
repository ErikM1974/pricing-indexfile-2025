```

## Example Calculations

### Small Order (15 shirts, 2 locations)
- Garment: $5.00 ÷ 0.6 = $8.33
- Transfers: 1 Medium ($9.50) + 1 Left Chest ($6.00) = $15.50
- Labor: $2.00 × 2 = $4.00
- Freight: $1.00 × 2 = $2.00
- LTM: $50 ÷ 15 = $3.33 per shirt
- **Total per shirt: $33.16**

### Medium Order (50 shirts, 2 locations)
- Garment: $5.00 ÷ 0.6 = $8.33
- Transfers: 1 Medium ($6.50) + 1 Left Chest ($4.00) = $10.50
- Labor: $2.00 × 2 = $4.00
- Freight: $0.75 × 2 = $1.50
- LTM: $0 (over 24 pieces)
- **Total per shirt: $24.33**

### Large Order (100 shirts, 3 locations)
