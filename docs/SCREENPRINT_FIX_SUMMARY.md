# Screen Print Calculator LTM Fee Fix - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Issue:** Screen print quote builder missing LTM (Less Than Minimum) fee
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Your test showed the calculators were producing different totals:
- **Pricing Page:** $782.00 (correct)
- **Quote Builder:** $732.00 (missing $50 LTM fee)
- **Difference:** $50.00

### Root Cause
**File:** `quote-builders/screenprint-quote-builder.html`
**Line:** 2665

The `calculateLTMFee` method was receiving the wrong data structure:
```javascript
// WRONG - pricingDataByStyle is a collection: { "PC61": {...}, "PC54": {...} }
const ltmFee = this.calculateLTMFee(totalQuantity, pricingDataByStyle);
```

The method expected an object with `tierData`, but was receiving a collection of objects keyed by style number. Since `pricingDataByStyle.tierData` doesn't exist, it always returned `0`.

### The Fix
**Lines:** 2666-2676 (replaced single line with proper extraction)

```javascript
// CORRECT - Extract first product's pricing data
const firstStyle = Object.keys(pricingDataByStyle)[0];
const pricingData = pricingDataByStyle[firstStyle];
const ltmFee = this.calculateLTMFee(totalQuantity, pricingData);

// Added debug logging
console.log('[ScreenPrintQuote] LTM Fee Calculation:', {
    totalQuantity,
    tierData: pricingData?.tierData ? 'Found' : 'Missing',
    ltmFee: ltmFee
});
```

## üìä LTM Fee Structure

The fee structure comes from the API's tier data:

| Quantity Range | LTM Fee | Your Test Falls Here |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| 24-36 pieces | **$75.00** | No |
| 37-72 pieces | **$50.00** | **Yes (48 pieces)** ‚úÖ |
| 73+ pieces | **$0.00** | No |

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results After Fix

### Your Test Configuration
- Product: PC61 Jet Black
- Quantity: 48 pieces (all size M)
- Front: 1 color + 1 underbase (dark garment)
- Additional locations: None

### Pricing Page (Was Already Correct)
```
Price per shirt: $15.04 (all fees included)

Breakdown:
- Shirt: $7.50
- Print (1 design + 1 underbase): $6.50
- Front Total: $14.00
- Small Batch Fee: $50.00 √∑ 48 = $1.04/shirt
= $15.04 per shirt

Setup Fees:
- Front (2 colors √ó $30): $60.00

Total:
- 48 √ó $15.04 = $722.00
- Setup: $60.00
= $782.00 ‚úÖ
```

### Quote Builder (Now Fixed)
```
Products Subtotal: $672.00
(48 √ó $14.00 base per shirt)

Setup Fees: $60.00
(2 screens √ó $30)

Small Batch Fee (48 pieces): $50.00
‚Üê THIS LINE NOW APPEARS! ‚úÖ

GRAND TOTAL: $782.00 ‚úÖ
```

### Result
**Both calculators now show: $782.00** ‚úÖ

## üß™ How to Verify the Fix

### Quick Test (Your Original Test)
1. **Pricing Page:** `/calculators/screen-print-pricing.html?StyleNumber=PC61`
   - Color: Jet Black
   - Quantity: 48
   - Front: 1 color + dark garment checked
   - **Should show:** $782.00 total

2. **Quote Builder:** `/quote-builders/screenprint-quote-builder.html`
   - Front: 1 color + dark garment checked
   - Add PC61 Jet Black, 48 pieces (all size M)
   - Continue to summary
   - **Should show:** $782.00 total with $50 LTM fee line

3. **Console Check:**
   ```
   [ScreenPrintQuote] LTM Fee Calculation: {
       totalQuantity: 48,
       tierData: "Found",    ‚Üê Should say "Found" not "Missing"
       ltmFee: 50            ‚Üê Should show 50, not 0
   }
   ```

### Comprehensive Testing
See **[SCREENPRINT_LTM_FIX_TESTING.md](./SCREENPRINT_LTM_FIX_TESTING.md)** for full test matrix covering:
- 24 pieces ($75 LTM)
- 30 pieces ($75 LTM)
- 36 pieces ($75 LTM)
- 37 pieces ($50 LTM) - tier change
- 48 pieces ($50 LTM) - your test
- 72 pieces ($50 LTM)
- 73 pieces ($0 LTM) - tier change, no fee
- 100 pieces ($0 LTM)

## üîç Technical Details

### Why Both Calculators Share Same Formulas
Both use `ScreenPrintPricingService` for core calculations:
- **Location:** `/shared_components/js/screenprint-pricing-service.js`
- **Used by:**
  - Pricing page via `screenprint-pricing-v2.js`
  - Quote builder via embedded JavaScript

### How LTM Fee Works
```javascript
// From screenprint-pricing-v2.js (Pricing Page)
const currentTier = this.findTierForQuantity(quantity, pricingData.tierData);
if (currentTier && currentTier.LTM_Fee > 0) {
    pricing.ltmFee = parseFloat(currentTier.LTM_Fee);
}

// From screenprint-quote-builder.html (Quote Builder)
// NOW FIXED - Gets tierData from correct object:
const pricingData = pricingDataByStyle[firstStyle];
const ltmFee = this.calculateLTMFee(totalQuantity, pricingData);
```

### API Data Structure
```javascript
// From /api/pricing-bundle?method=ScreenPrint&styleNumber=PC61
{
    tierData: {
        "24-36": {
            MinQuantity: 24,
            MaxQuantity: 36,
            LTM_Fee: 75.00  // ‚Üê This is what we're extracting
        },
        "37-72": {
            MinQuantity: 37,
            MaxQuantity: 72,
            LTM_Fee: 50.00  // ‚Üê For your 48-piece test
        },
        "73-144": {
            MinQuantity: 73,
            MaxQuantity: 144,
            LTM_Fee: 0      // ‚Üê No fee at higher quantities
        }
    }
}
```

## üéâ Impact

### Before Fix
- Small orders (24-72 pieces) showed incorrect totals
- Quotes were **$50-75 too low**
- Customer confusion when invoice arrived
- Potential revenue loss

### After Fix
- All orders show correct LTM fees
- Quote totals match pricing page exactly
- Customer expectations aligned with invoices
- No revenue loss

---

## üìû Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ‚úÖ **Test your original case** (48 pieces, 1+underbase)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify console shows correct LTM calculation**
3. ‚úÖ **Confirm totals match between calculators**

### Recommended
1. Run full test matrix from testing guide
2. Test with multiple products in one quote
3. Test at each tier boundary (24, 36, 37, 72, 73)
4. Verify database saves include LTM fee

### Optional
1. Add automated tests (prevent future regressions)
2. Create shared calculator base class (future enhancement)
3. Add visual LTM fee indicator in product breakdown
