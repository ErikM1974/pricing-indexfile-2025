# DTG Pricing Tier Display Fix Summary

## Date: May 29, 2025

## Overview
Successfully fixed the DTG pricing page tier display issue where "72-99999" was showing instead of a clean "72+" label. The fix ensures professional presentation and stable table structure when switching between print locations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tier Label Display ✓
- **Problem**: The highest tier was displaying as "72-99999" which looked unprofessional
- **Solution**: Modified `dp5-helper.js` to format tier labels properly:
  - Added `formatTierLabel()` function that converts "N-99999" to "N+"
  - Tiers with upper limit of 99999 now display as "N+" (e.g., "72+")
  - Regular tiers display as "N-M" (e.g., "48-71")

### 2. Table Structure Stability ✓
- **Problem**: The pricing table was breaking/reformatting when switching print locations
- **Solution**:
  - Disabled the problematic `dtg-price-grouping-v4.js` script that was interfering with table structure
  - Added stable CSS rules to maintain consistent table layout
  - Enhanced the dp5-helper.js to handle tier formatting without disrupting the DOM

### 3. Missing Tier Issue - Root Cause Identified and Fixed ✓
- **Problem**: The page initially showed only two tiers (48-71 and 72+) instead of three
- **Root Cause**:
  - The `pricing-matrix-capture.js` was capturing data from the Caspio table before it was fully loaded
  - The Caspio datapage loads rows asynchronously, and the initial capture happened too early, missing the "24-47" tier row
  - When clicking "Left Chest Only", the DTG adapter would then provide the complete data with all 3 tiers
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `pricing-matrix-capture.js` to validate that all expected DTG tiers are present before completing the capture
  - Added a check for DTG pricing to ensure all 3 tiers (24-47, 48-71, 72+) are captured
  - If any tiers are missing, the capture returns null to trigger a retry
  - This ensures the pricing table always shows all available tiers once the data is fully loaded

## Files Modified

### 1. `/shared_components/js/dp5-helper.js`
- Added `formatTierLabel()` function to clean up tier display
- Enhanced the `updateCustomPricingGrid()` function to apply formatting
- Version updated to v5.1

### 2. `/dtg-pricing.html`
- Commented out the problematic `dtg-price-grouping-v4.js` script inclusion
- Added inline CSS for stable table structure

### 3. `/shared_components/js/pricing-matrix-capture.js`
- Added validation for DTG pricing to ensure all expected tiers are captured
- Added check for missing tiers that triggers retry if incomplete
- Prevents premature capture of partially loaded Caspio tables

## Technical Details

### Tier Formatting Logic
```javascript
function formatTierLabel(label) {
    if (!label || typeof label !== 'string') return label;
    
    const match = label.match(/^(\d+)-(\d+)$/);
    if (match) {
        const [, start, end] = match;
        if (end === '99999') {
            return `${start}+`;
        }
    }
    return label;
}
```

### CSS Stability Rules
```css
#custom-pricing-grid {
    table-layout: fixed !important;
}

#custom-pricing-grid th,
#custom-pricing-grid td {
    width: auto !important;
    white-space: nowrap !important;
}
```

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **API Level**: Returns all tier definitions (24-47, 48-71, 72+)
2. **Caspio Level**: Loads tier data asynchronously into the pricing table
3. **Pricing Matrix Capture**: Now validates all tiers are present before capturing (fixed)
4. **DTG Adapter**: Provides complete master bundle with all tiers as backup
5. **DP5 Helper**: Displays all tiers with proper formatting

## Results

### Before Fix
- Tier display: "48-71", "72-99999" (missing "24-47" on initial load)
- Table structure: Unstable, would break when switching locations
- User experience: Unprofessional appearance, incomplete pricing information

### After Fix
- Tier display: "24-47", "48-71", "72+" (all tiers shown with clean formatting)
- Table structure: Stable and consistent
- User experience: Clean, professional presentation
- Complete pricing: All tiers displayed once data is fully loaded

## Testing Performed
1. Loaded DTG pricing page with product PC61 in Athletic Heather
2. Verified tier labels display correctly ("72+" instead of "72-99999")
3. Confirmed all 3 tiers (24-47, 48-71, 72+) are displayed after data loads
4. Verified table structure remains stable when switching print locations
5. Confirmed LTM fee calculations still work correctly
6. Analyzed console logs to identify timing issue with Caspio table loading
7. Tested the retry mechanism for incomplete tier captures

## Outstanding Issues
1. **Print Location Dropdown**: The dropdown is not opening properly (separate issue)

## Recommendations
1. Monitor the capture retry mechanism to ensure it doesn't cause performance issues
2. Consider adding a loading indicator while waiting for all tiers to load
3. Add unit tests for the tier formatting function
4. Consider implementing a more robust "table ready" detection for Caspio tables
5. Fix the print location dropdown functionality in a separate task
