### The Pricing Bug Fix

**Problem**: Cap embroidery page showing $18/cap instead of $24 for quantity 31

**Solution**: Created new implementation using refactored systems
- File: `cap-embroidery-pricing-new.html`
- Status: ✅ Working correctly
- Verified: All pricing tiers calculate accurately

### Key Deliverables

#### 2. Complete Design System
- Button, Card, Form, Modal components
- Layout system (Grid, Stack, Container)
- Toast notifications
- Loading states
- Theme support (light/dark)

#### 3. Smart API System
- Unified API client
- Intelligent caching
- Offline queue
- Error handling
- Request retry logic

#### 4. Documentation
- `docs/refactoring-complete-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide
- `docs/refactoring-visual-summary.md` - Visual diagrams
- `docs/developer-quick-reference.md` - Developer cheatsheet
- `docs/cap-embroidery-migration-guide.md` - Migration instructions

#### 5. Test Files
- `test-files/test-api-phase5-integration.html` - API testing
- `test-files/test-design-system-phase6.html` - UI component showcase
