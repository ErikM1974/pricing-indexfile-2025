# Pricing URL Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The server is configured to serve pricing pages at routes like `/pricing/embroidery`, `/pricing/dtg`, etc., but some JavaScript components were trying to access them directly as HTML files (`/embroidery-pricing.html`, `/dtg-pricing.html`, etc.).

## Files Fixed

### 1. product/components/decoration-selector.js
- **Issue**: Using direct HTML filenames in paths
- **Fixed**: Changed all paths from `'/embroidery-pricing.html'` to `'/pricing/embroidery'` format
- **Impact**: This component is used to navigate users from the product page to pricing pages

### 2. utils.js (root directory)
- **Issue**: `createProductUrl()` function was building URLs with HTML filenames
- **Fixed**: Changed paths from `'embroidery-pricing.html'` to `'/pricing/embroidery'` format
- **Impact**: This utility function is used to create product URLs throughout the application

### 3. shared_components/js/utils.js
- **Issue**: Same as above - duplicate utils file with same issue
- **Fixed**: Same fix applied - changed to proper `/pricing/*` routes
- **Impact**: Ensures consistency across all components using this shared utility

## Server Routes (Verified Correct)
The server.js file correctly serves these pages at:
- `/pricing/embroidery` → embroidery-pricing.html
- `/pricing/cap-embroidery` → cap-embroidery-pricing-integrated.html
- `/pricing/dtg` → dtg-pricing.html
- `/pricing/screen-print` → screen-print-pricing.html
- `/pricing/dtf` → dtf-pricing.html

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test navigation from product page to each pricing page type
2. Verify that the decoration selector component correctly navigates to pricing pages
3. Check any cart or quote functionality that might use the `createProductUrl` function
4. Test with different embellishment types to ensure proper routing

## No Other Issues Found
After thorough searching, these were the only files containing direct HTML references to pricing pages. All other references use the correct `/pricing/*` format.
