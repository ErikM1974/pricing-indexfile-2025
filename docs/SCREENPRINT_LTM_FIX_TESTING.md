# Screen Print LTM Fee Fix - Testing Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Bug Fixed:** LTM (Less Than Minimum) fee missing from quote builder
**Root Cause:** Wrong parameter passed to `calculateLTMFee` method
**Fix Applied:** Line 2665-2676 in `screenprint-quote-builder.html`

---

## üêõ The Bug

### What Was Wrong
```javascript
// LINE 2665 - BEFORE (WRONG)
const ltmFee = this.calculateLTMFee(totalQuantity, pricingDataByStyle);
//                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                         This is { "PC61": {...}, "PC54": {...} }
//                         But method expects pricingData object directly!
```

The `calculateLTMFee` method was checking for `pricingDataByStyle.tierData`, but `pricingDataByStyle` is actually a **collection** of pricing data objects keyed by style number (like `{ "PC61": {tierData: ...}, "PC54": {tierData: ...} }`).

Since `pricingDataByStyle.tierData` doesn't exist, the method always returned `0`.

### The Fix
```javascript
// LINES 2666-2669 - AFTER (CORRECT)
const firstStyle = Object.keys(pricingDataByStyle)[0];
const pricingData = pricingDataByStyle[firstStyle];
const ltmFee = this.calculateLTMFee(totalQuantity, pricingData);
```

Now we extract the first product's pricing data (all products share the same tier structure anyway), and pass the correct object.

## ‚úÖ LTM Fee Structure

| Quantity Range | LTM Fee | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| 24-36 pieces | **$75.00** | Higher small batch fee |
| 37-72 pieces | **$50.00** | Lower small batch fee |
| 73+ pieces | **$0.00** | No fee (standard minimum met) |

These values come from the API's `tierData` structure:
```javascript
tierData: {
    "24-36": { MinQuantity: 24, MaxQuantity: 36, LTM_Fee: 75.00 },
    "37-72": { MinQuantity: 37, MaxQuantity: 72, LTM_Fee: 50.00 },
    "73-144": { MinQuantity: 73, MaxQuantity: 144, LTM_Fee: 0 }
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### Test Setup
1. Clear browser cache
2. Open both calculators in separate tabs:
   - **Tab 1:** `/calculators/screen-print-pricing.html?StyleNumber=PC61`
   - **Tab 2:** `/quote-builders/screenprint-quote-builder.html`

### Test Case Matrix

| Test # | Qty | Front Colors | Expected LTM | Expected Price/pc | Expected Total | Notes |
|--------|-----|--------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| **1** | **24** | 1 + underbase | **$75.00** | $14.00 + $3.13 = $17.13 | $486.00 + $60 = $546 | Lower 24-36 boundary |
| **2** | **30** | 1 + underbase | **$75.00** | $14.00 + $2.50 = $16.50 | $495.00 + $60 = $555 | Mid 24-36 tier |
| **3** | **36** | 1 + underbase | **$75.00** | $14.00 + $2.08 = $16.08 | $579.00 + $60 = $639 | Upper 24-36 boundary |
| **4** | **37** | 1 + underbase | **$50.00** | ~$14.00 + $1.35 | ~$568.00 + $60 | Tier change |
| **5** | **48** | 1 + underbase | **$50.00** | $14.00 + $1.04 = **$15.04** | $722.00 + $60 = **$782** | **YOUR TEST** |
| **6** | **72** | 1 + underbase | **$50.00** | $14.00 + $0.69 = $14.69 | $1058.00 + $60 = $1118 | Upper 37-72 boundary |
| **7** | **73** | 1 + underbase | **$0.00** | ~$13.50 | ~$986.00 + $60 = $1046 | Tier change, no fee |
| **8** | **100** | 1 + underbase | **$0.00** | ~$13.50 | ~$1350.00 + $60 = $1410 | Mid 73-144 tier |

### Test Procedure for Each Case

#### Pricing Page:
1. Navigate to `/calculators/screen-print-pricing.html?StyleNumber=PC61`
2. Select color: **Jet Black**
3. Select tier or enter quantity
4. Set front colors to **1**
5. Check "Dark Garment" (adds underbase)
6. **Record:**
   - Price per shirt (includes LTM if applicable)
   - Total setup fee
   - LTM fee amount (if shown)
   - Grand total

#### Quote Builder:
1. Navigate to `/quote-builders/screenprint-quote-builder.html`
2. **Step 1:** Set front colors to **1**, check "Dark Garment"
3. **Step 2:** Search for **PC61**, select **Jet Black**
4. **Step 3:** Enter quantity in size M (all in one size for simplicity)
5. Click "Continue to Summary"
6. **Record:**
   - Products Subtotal
   - Setup Fees
   - Small Batch Fee (should show if qty < 73)
   - Grand Total

#### Verification:
```
‚úÖ PASS if:
- LTM fees match between both calculators
- Grand totals match (within $0.01 due to rounding)
- LTM fee displays in quote builder summary
- Console shows: "[ScreenPrintQuote] LTM Fee Calculation: {...}"

‚ùå FAIL if:
- LTM fee is $0 when it should be $50 or $75
- Totals don't match between calculators
- No LTM fee line shows in quote builder
```

---

## üîç Console Debugging

After the fix, the quote builder will log LTM calculation:

```javascript
[ScreenPrintQuote] LTM Fee Calculation: {
    totalQuantity: 48,
    tierData: "Found",  // ‚Üê Should say "Found" not "Missing"
    ltmFee: 50          // ‚Üê Should show correct fee, not 0
}
```

**If you see:**
- `tierData: "Missing"` ‚Üí Bug not fixed, still passing wrong data
- `ltmFee: 0` when quantity < 73 ‚Üí Check API tier data has LTM_Fee values

## üìä Expected Results for Test Case #5 (Your Original Test)

### Configuration:
- Product: PC61 Jet Black
- Quantity: 48 pieces (all size M)
- Front: 1 color + 1 underbase (dark garment)
- Additional locations: None

### Pricing Page Result:
```
Price per shirt: $15.04
(all fees included)

Breakdown:
- Shirt: $7.50
- Print (1 + underbase): $6.50
- Subtotal: $14.00
- Small Batch Fee: $50.00 √∑ 48 = $1.04/shirt
= $15.04 per shirt

Setup Fees:
- 2 colors √ó $30.00 = $60.00

Order Total:
- 48 √ó $15.04 = $722.00
- Setup: $60.00
= $782.00
```

### Quote Builder Result (AFTER FIX):
```
Products Subtotal: $672.00
(48 √ó $14.00)

Setup Fees: $60.00
(2 screens √ó $30)

Small Batch Fee (48 pieces): $50.00
‚Üê THIS LINE SHOULD NOW APPEAR!

GRAND TOTAL: $782.00
```

### Comparison:
```
Pricing Page:  $782.00 ‚úÖ
Quote Builder: $782.00 ‚úÖ
MATCH! ‚úÖ
```

## üéØ Critical Verification Points

### 1. LTM Fee Displays in Quote Builder
**Location:** Quote summary (Step 3)

Should see:
```html
<div class="summary-row" style="color: #ff9800;">
    <span>Small Batch Fee (48 pieces):</span>
    <span>$50.00</span>
</div>
```

### 2. LTM Fee Included in Grand Total
```javascript
grandTotal = subtotal + setupFee + ltmFee
           = $672.00 + $60.00 + $50.00
           = $782.00 ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Console Log Confirms Calculation
```
[ScreenPrintQuote] LTM Fee Calculation: {
    totalQuantity: 48,
    tierData: "Found",
    ltmFee: 50
}
```

### 4. Database Save Includes LTM Fee
Check the quote service saves ltmFee:
```javascript
this.currentPricing = {
    totalQuantity: 48,
    productPricing: [...],
    subtotal: 672.00,
    setupFee: 60.00,
    ltmFee: 50.00,      // ‚Üê Should NOT be 0
    grandTotal: 782.00
};
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing $0 LTM fee

**Check 1:** Browser cache cleared?
```bash
# Hard refresh
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

**Check 2:** Console shows correct data?
```javascript
// Should see:
[ScreenPrintQuote] LTM Fee Calculation: {
    totalQuantity: 48,
    tierData: "Found",  // ‚Üê If "Missing", fix didn't work
    ltmFee: 50
}
```

**Check 3:** File saved correctly?
```bash
# Check line 2666-2669 exists:
grep -n "const firstStyle = Object.keys" screenprint-quote-builder.html
# Should show line number around 2666
```

### Issue: LTM fee shows wrong amount

**Check:** API tier data
```javascript
// Test in pricing page console:
window.screenPrintCalc.state.pricingData.tierData

// Should show:
{
    "24-36": { LTM_Fee: 75 },
    "37-72": { LTM_Fee: 50 },
    "73-144": { LTM_Fee: 0 }
}
```

### Issue: Totals still don't match

**Check:** Other differences (setup fees, print costs)
```javascript
// Compare base product pricing first:
// Should both show $14.00 for base (before LTM)
```
