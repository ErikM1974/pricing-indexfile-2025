## ✅ Phase 2 Complete - Archive Folders Consolidated

### Summary
- **Folders Moved**: 2 archive folders
- **Files Archived**: 40 files (31 from archive/, 9 from _archive/)
- **Location**: `archive-2025-cleanup/old-archive/` and `archive-2025-cleanup/underscore-archive/`
- **Result**: SUCCESS - Website fully functional

### What Was Moved

- **31 files** including:
  - Historical documentation in `/archive/docs-historical/`
  - 2025 cleanup files in `/archive/2025/`

#### /_archive/ Folder:
- **9 files** including:
  - `screen-print-pricing-old.html`
  - Old screenprint test files in `/screenprint-old-tests/`
  - Legacy pricing implementations

### Verification Results

✅ **Main Files**: Working
- index.html - Present and functional
- staff-dashboard.html - Present and functional

✅ **Calculators**: Working
- All 18 calculator HTML files intact
- No broken dependencies

✅ **Navigation**: Working
- No archive files were linked from production pages
- All navigation links functional

### Impact Analysis

**Before Phase 2:**
- Root directory had 2 archive folders
- Confusing mix of old and current files
- Archive folders contained outdated versions

**After Phase 2:**
- Root directory cleaner (no archive folders)
- All archived content preserved in consolidated location
- Clear separation between active and archived code

### Safety Measures Taken
1. Files were MOVED, not deleted
2. All files preserved in archive-2025-cleanup/
3. Folder structure maintained for easy restoration
4. No production code was affected

### Rollback Instructions (If Ever Needed)
```bash
# To restore archive folder:
mv archive-2025-cleanup/old-archive/ archive/

# To restore _archive folder:
mv archive-2025-cleanup/underscore-archive/ _archive/
```

### File Count Summary
- **Phase 1**: 73 test files moved
- **Phase 2**: 40 archive files moved
- **Total Files Cleaned**: 113 files
- **Root Directory**: Much cleaner and organized

### Next Steps
Phase 2 is complete and successful. Ready for:
- **Phase 3**: Resolve version conflicts (v3 vs v4 files)
- **Phase 4**: Organize directory structure
- **Phase 5**: Remove duplicate functionality
