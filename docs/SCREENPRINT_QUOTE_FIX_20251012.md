# Screen Print Quote Builder - Emergency Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Issue:** TypeError - Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 What Went Wrong

### The Error
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
    at screenprint-quote-builder.html:2735:133
```

### Root Cause
I made a critical mistake by **assuming** the `calculateProductPricing()` method returned a `unitPrice` property without actually reading the code to verify.

**What I Assumed:**
```javascript
{
    unitPrice: 17.00,  // ❌ This property DOES NOT EXIST
    lineTotal: 510.00,
    quantity: 30
}
```

**What Actually Exists:**
```javascript
{
    perShirtTotal: 17.00,  // ✅ This is the correct property
    lineTotal: 510.00,
    quantity: 30,
    sizesPricing: {...},
    baseCostSubtotal: 510.00,
    additionalCost: 0,
    // NO unitPrice property!
}
```

## 🔧 The Fix

### File Modified
`quote-builders/screenprint-quote-builder.html` (Lines 2683-2686)

### Before (BROKEN)
```javascript
const productsWithLTM = productPricing.map(p => ({
    ...p,
    basePriceWithoutLTM: p.unitPrice,              // ❌ undefined
    ltmImpact: ltmImpactPerShirt,
    finalUnitPrice: p.unitPrice + ltmImpactPerShirt,  // ❌ undefined + number = NaN
    finalLineTotal: (p.unitPrice + ltmImpactPerShirt) * p.quantity  // ❌ NaN
}));
```

### After (FIXED)
```javascript
const productsWithLTM = productPricing.map(p => ({
    ...p,
    basePriceWithoutLTM: p.perShirtTotal,          // ✅ Correct property
    ltmImpact: ltmImpactPerShirt,
    finalUnitPrice: p.perShirtTotal + ltmImpactPerShirt,  // ✅ Works!
    finalLineTotal: (p.perShirtTotal + ltmImpactPerShirt) * p.quantity  // ✅ Works!
}));
```

### Change Summary
Replaced 3 instances of `p.unitPrice` with `p.perShirtTotal`

## 📐 Understanding perShirtTotal

### What It Contains
From `calculateProductPricing()` line 2978:
```javascript
const lineTotal = baseCostSubtotal + totalAdditionalCost;
const perShirtTotal = lineTotal / product.quantity;
```

**Components included in perShirtTotal:**
- ✅ Base garment cost (with margin applied)
- ✅ Print costs (with margin applied)
- ✅ Safety stripes surcharge (if applicable)
- ✅ Additional location costs (if applicable)
- ❌ LTM fee (NOT included - added separately)

This is **exactly** what we need for the breakdown!

## 📊 Math Verification

### 30-Piece Example ($75 LTM Fee)
```
perShirtTotal:    $17.00  (base + print + options)
ltmImpact:        $75.00 ÷ 30 = $2.50
─────────────────────────────────
finalUnitPrice:   $17.00 + $2.50 = $19.50 ✅
finalLineTotal:   $19.50 × 30 = $585.00 ✅

With setup:
Products:         $585.00
Setup:            $60.00
─────────────────────────────────
Grand Total:      $645.00 ✅
```

### 48-Piece Example ($50 LTM Fee)
```
perShirtTotal:    $14.00
ltmImpact:        $50.00 ÷ 48 = $1.04
─────────────────────────────────
finalUnitPrice:   $14.00 + $1.04 = $15.04 ✅
finalLineTotal:   $15.04 × 48 = $722.00 ✅

With setup:
Products:         $722.00
Setup:            $60.00
─────────────────────────────────
Grand Total:      $782.00 ✅
```

### 73+ Pieces (No LTM)
```
perShirtTotal:    $12.00
ltmImpact:        $0.00 (no fee)
─────────────────────────────────
finalUnitPrice:   $12.00 ✅
finalLineTotal:   $12.00 × 73 = $876.00 ✅
```

## 🎯 What Should Now Work

After refreshing the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R):

### With LTM Fee (30 or 48 pieces)
```
✅ Per-Shirt Pricing Breakdown shows
✅ Base Price displays correctly
✅ Small Batch Fee Impact shows per-shirt amount
✅ Final Price per Shirt displays
✅ Order Total calculates correctly
✅ Quote Total includes LTM in subtotal
✅ Info note explains LTM calculation
```

### Without LTM Fee (73+ pieces)
```
✅ No per-shirt breakdown box (cleaner display)
✅ Simple pricing shown
✅ No info note about LTM
✅ Totals calculate correctly
```

## 🚫 Lessons Learned (My Mistakes)

### What I Did Wrong
1. **Made assumptions** about data structure without verification
2. **Didn't read the actual method** that returns the data
3. **Moved too fast** without testing immediately
4. **Broke working code** by not understanding it first

### What I Should Have Done
1. ✅ Read `calculateProductPricing()` FIRST
2. ✅ Console.log the actual return object
3. ✅ Test immediately after making changes
4. ✅ Verify property existence before using

### Process Improvement
**Always trace data flow:**
```
User Action
  ↓
generateQuoteSummary()
  ↓
this.calculateProductPricing() ← READ THIS METHOD FIRST!
  ↓
returns { perShirtTotal, lineTotal, ... } ← VERIFY STRUCTURE!
  ↓
Use correct property names ← DON'T ASSUME!
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R):

- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Per-shirt breakdown displays (30 pieces)
- [ ] Shows $17.00 base + $2.50 LTM = $19.50
- [ ] Order total: 30 × $19.50 = $585.00
- [ ] Grand total: $585.00 + $60.00 = $645.00
- [ ] Works for 48 pieces ($50 LTM)
- [ ] Works for 73+ pieces (no LTM display)

## 📝 Summary

**Problem:** Referenced non-existent property `p.unitPrice`
**Solution:** Use correct property `p.perShirtTotal`
**Impact:** 3-line fix, no logic changes
**Status:** Ready for testing

**The breakdown should now display correctly with proper per-shirt pricing including LTM fee impact!**

**Apology:** I made a careless error by not reading the code before making assumptions. I should have traced the data structure first. This has been fixed and won't happen again.
