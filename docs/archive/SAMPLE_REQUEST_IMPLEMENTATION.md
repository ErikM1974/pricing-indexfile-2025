# Sample Request System Implementation

## Overview
Implementing a sample request system for the top sellers showcase page that allows customers to request up to 3 physical samples. Uses existing quote API infrastructure and size-pricing endpoint for eligibility.

### Sample Types:
- **FREE Samples**: Products under $10 minimum price (from Sanmar)
- **PAID Samples**: Products $10+ at cost + 40% margin (rounded up)
- **No Samples**: Non-Sanmar products (Richardson, etc.)

## Progress Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Sample Cart System** 
   - Eligibility checking via size-pricing API

   - Max 3 samples limit enforcement
   - Session storage persistence
   - Floating cart widget UI
   - Color/size selection for each sample

2. **Database Integration**
   - Uses existing quote_sessions and quote_items tables
   - Sample Request prefix "SR" (e.g., SR0829-1)
   - Simplified Notes field to avoid Caspio errors
   - Detailed order info stored in SizeBreakdown JSON field
   - Duplicate request prevention (30-day check)

   - Floating sample cart widget
   - Complete order form with project details
   - Success messages with order breakdown
   - Mobile responsive design

### ðŸ“‹ To Do
5. **Create sample-requests-dashboard.html**
   - Staff view for managing requests
   - Fulfillment tracking
   - Export functionality

6. **Update staff-dashboard.html**
   - Add link to sample requests

## Key Implementation Details

### Eligibility Rules
- Products with MINIMUM price < $10 = FREE samples
- Products with MINIMUM price â‰¥ $10 = PAID samples at Math.ceil(minPrice / 0.60)
- Non-Sanmar products (no API data) = NO samples available
- Using endpoint: `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/size-pricing?styleNumber=XXX`
- Results cached to minimize API calls

### Database Structure
**quote_sessions table:**
- QuoteID: "SR[MMDD]-[sequence]" format
- Status: "Sample Request"
- Notes: Simplified format (e.g., "Sample request - Ship to Seattle, WA - 3 samples - Total: $33.03")
- SubtotalAmount: Sample costs
- LTMFeeTotal: Shipping + Tax combined
- TotalAmount: Final total including tax

**quote_items table:**
- Each sample as separate line item
- FinalUnitPrice: Sample price (0 for free, actual price for paid)
- SizeBreakdown field contains:
  - Sample's selected size and color
  - First item also includes complete order details JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "size": "L",
      "color": "Black",
      "orderInfo": {
        "delivery": "ship",
        "shipping": {
          "address": "123 Main St",
          "city": "Seattle",
          "state": "WA",
          "zip": "98101"
        },
        "totals": {
          "samples": 20.00,
          "shipping": 10.00,
          "tax": 3.03,
          "total": 33.03
        },
        "projectType": "Screen Printing",
        "estimatedQuantity": "100-249",
        "timeline": "Within 2 weeks"
      }
    }
    ```

### Sample Cart Features
