# Cap Embroidery Beta Deployment - Complete! ✅

## Summary

Mr. Erik, the cap embroidery pricing fix has been successfully deployed! The beta button is now live and fully functional.

## What Was Fixed

### The $18 Bug
- **Problem**: Original page showed $18 for 24-47 caps when it should be $24
- **Root Cause**: `cap-embroidery-ltm-fix.js` was hardcoding the wrong price
- **Solution**: New beta page uses dynamic Caspio data instead of hardcoded values

## How to Test

1. Go to any product page (e.g., http://localhost:3000/product.html?StyleNumber=C112&COLOR=Black)
2. Click the **"Cap Embroidery Beta"** button at the top
3. You'll see the new pricing page with:
   - Correct $24 pricing for 24-47 caps ✅
   - Working stitch count options (5k/8k/10k)
   - Back logo feature ($1 per 1,000 stitches)
   - Instant price updates
   - All features from the original page

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Pricing shows $24 (not $18) for quantity 24-47
- ✅ Caspio data loads properly
- ✅ Quick quote calculator works instantly
- ✅ Stitch count dropdown functions correctly
- ✅ Back logo pricing calculates accurately
- ✅ Color swatches display when available
- ✅ Pricing table shows all tiers
- ✅ Analytics tracking is active
- ✅ Feedback widget is integrated

## What's Different

### Original Page
- 20+ JavaScript files with conflicting logic
- Hardcoded price overrides
- Shows incorrect $18 pricing

### Beta Page
- Single clean implementation
- Dynamic pricing from Caspio
- Shows correct $24 pricing
- Easier to maintain

## Analytics & Feedback

The beta page includes:
- **Analytics tracking**: Monitors button clicks and page performance
- **Feedback widget**: Users can report issues directly from the page

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage**: Watch analytics to see adoption rate
2. **Collect Feedback**: Review user feedback from the widget
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Once confident, can replace the original page
4. **Keep Original**: The original page remains untouched as a fallback

## Rollback Plan

If any issues arise:
1. Simply remove the beta button from product pages
2. Original cap embroidery page remains functional
3. No data or functionality is lost
