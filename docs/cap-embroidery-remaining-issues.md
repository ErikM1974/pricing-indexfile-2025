# Cap Embroidery Page - Remaining Issues Summary

## Fixed Issues ✅
1. **CONFIG is not defined error** - Fixed by moving CONFIG.FEATURES inside the IIFE closure in app-config.js

## Non-Critical Warnings (Expected Behavior) ⚠️

### 1. Quote Adapter Warnings
- **Missing #add-to-cart-section**: The quote adapter tries to replace this element, but it doesn't exist in our HTML
- **Impact**: None - the quote adapter handles this gracefully
- **Resolution**: Can be ignored or we could add an empty div with this ID

### 2. DP5-Helper Warnings
- **Missing #size-quantity-grid-container**: DP5-helper expects this from add-to-cart.js
- **Messages**: 
  - "This is unexpected if add-to-cart.js or ProductQuantityUI is supposed to create it"
  - "Bailing from AddToCart UI update by dp5-helper"
- **Impact**: None - quantity selection still works through other UI elements
- **Resolution**: Expected behavior since we removed add-to-cart.js

### 3. Pricing Matrix Save Warning
- **Message**: "Cannot save matrix: SessionID is missing or NWCACart not ready"
- **Cause**: NWCACart has been removed (quote-only workflow)
- **Impact**: Pricing matrix won't be saved to server (not needed for quote workflow)
- **Resolution**: Expected behavior for quote-only workflow

## Page Functionality Status ✅
Despite these warnings, the page is functioning correctly:
- ✅ Pricing data loads successfully
- ✅ Hero quantity calculator works
- ✅ Stitch count selection works
- ✅ Back logo option works
- ✅ Custom pricing grid displays correctly
- ✅ Product images and colors load
- ✅ Universal header works
- ✅ Quote system is initialized

## Optional Improvements
1. **Clean up console warnings** by:
   - Adding empty placeholder divs for expected elements
   - Modifying dp5-helper.js to check for quote-only mode
   - Updating pricing-matrix-capture.js to skip server save in quote mode

2. **Update quote adapter** to:
   - Look for a different container if #add-to-cart-section doesn't exist
   - Create its own container for the quote builder UI

These are all cosmetic improvements - the page is fully functional as-is.
