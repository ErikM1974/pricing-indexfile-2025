# Screen Print Pricing Refactor Summary

## Overview
Refactored the screen print pricing page to use a modular architecture similar to DTG, focusing on simplified pricing display and removing confusion around setup fees and color counts.

## Key Changes

### 1. Modular Architecture
Created a clean separation of concerns with specialized modules:

- **screenprint-config.js**: Centralized configuration
  - Pricing thresholds and fees
  - Dark garment detection
  - UI settings and messages
  - Helper functions

- **screenprint-calculator.js**: Pricing calculation engine
  - Handles quantity and color count updates
  - Calculates setup fees with white base logic
  - Manages pricing state
  - Dispatches pricing events

- **screenprint-adapter.js**: Caspio integration (simplified)
  - Receives master bundle from Caspio
  - Processes pricing data by color count
  - Updates pricing table visibility
  - Handles errors and timeouts

- **screenprint-integration.js**: UI component integration
  - Creates the new pricing interface
  - Binds event handlers
  - Manages display updates
  - Handles user interactions

### 2. Simplified User Interface

#### Color Selection
- Simple dropdowns for front/back colors (1-6)
- Checkbox for adding second location
- Auto-detection of dark garments needing white base
- Clear visual feedback

#### Pricing Display
```
Your Pricing
━━━━━━━━━━━━
Quantity: 48
Base Price: $12.50/shirt × 48 = $600.00

Setup Fees: $150.00
Front (3 colors): $90
Back (2 colors): $60

TOTAL PRICE: $750.00
```

#### Setup Fee Calculator
- Toggle to spread setup cost across shirts
- Shows calculation: "$150 ÷ 48 shirts = $3.13"
- Editable quantity for "what-if" scenarios
- Updates total per shirt price

### 3. Removed Components
- Deleted quote builder system
- Removed quote-adapter-base.js integration
- Removed screenprint-quote-adapter.js
- Removed PDF generation features
- No contact forms or order buttons

### 4. Dark Garment Handling
- Auto-detects dark colors from predefined list
- Checkbox pre-selected for dark garments
- Automatically adds +1 color for white base
- Clear messaging about white underbase requirement

### 5. LTM Fee Implementation
- Minimum order: 24 pieces
- Standard minimum: 48 pieces
- $50 fee for orders 24-47
- Clear warning when fee applies
- Automatically included in total

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Color Counting**: Simple dropdowns eliminate confusion
2. **Transparent Setup Fees**: Shown separately with clear breakdown
3. **Combined Pricing**: Single total price for front+back printing
4. **Dark Garment Clarity**: Auto-detection with manual override
5. **No Surprises**: All costs visible upfront

## Technical Benefits

1. **Modular Design**: Easy to maintain and extend
2. **Event-Driven**: Components communicate via events
3. **Cached Calculations**: Better performance
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks
5. **Responsive**: Works on all devices

## Testing
Created test files to verify:
- Module loading
- Configuration values
- Calculator functionality
- Integration behavior
- Event communication

## Next Steps
1. Test with live Caspio data
2. Verify dark garment detection accuracy
3. Fine-tune setup fee display
4. Add analytics tracking
5. Monitor user feedback
