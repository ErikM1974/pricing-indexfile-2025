# Cap Embroidery Stitch Count Integration Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Stitch count dropdown not updating cart prices** - When users changed the stitch count (5,000/8,000/10,000), the pricing grid updated but the add to cart section prices remained unchanged.

2. **Stitch count not displayed in cart** - When items were added to cart, there was no indication of which stitch count was selected.

3. **LTM fee showing as $0.00** - The Less Than Minimum fee was being applied but displayed as "$0.00" instead of the actual $50.00 fee.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Stitch Count Dropdown Integration

**File**: `shared_components/js/cap-embroidery-adapter.js`

Added code to trigger cart total recalculation when stitch count changes:

```javascript
// In the stitch count dropdown change event listener (line 470-475)
if (window.updateCartTotal && typeof window.updateCartTotal === 'function') {
    console.log("[ADAPTER:CAP-EMB] Triggering cart total update after stitch count change");
    window.updateCartTotal();
} else {
    console.warn("[ADAPTER:CAP-EMB] updateCartTotal function not available");
}
```

This ensures that when users change the stitch count:
- The pricing grid updates (already working)
- The add to cart section prices recalculate based on the new stitch count
- The pricing explanation text updates to show the current stitch count

### 2. Added Stitch Count Display in Cart

**File**: `shared_components/js/add-to-cart.js`

Modified the success notification to display stitch count for cap embroidery items:

```javascript
// In showSuccessWithImageAndTitle function (lines 1230-1242)
const embType = document.createElement('p');
let embellishmentText = `Embellishment: ${productData.embellishmentType.replace(/-/g, ' ')}`;

// Add stitch count for cap embroidery
if (productData.embellishmentType === 'cap-embroidery' && productData.embellishmentOptions && productData.embellishmentOptions.stitchCount) {
    const stitchCount = parseInt(productData.embellishmentOptions.stitchCount).toLocaleString();
    embellishmentText += ` (${stitchCount} stitches)`;
}

embType.textContent = embellishmentText;
```

The stitch count is already being captured in the `handleAddToCart` function (lines 665-670) and stored in `embellishmentOptions.stitchCount`.

### 3. LTM Fee Display Issue

The LTM fee calculation appears to be working correctly in the pricing calculator. The issue of showing "$0.00" needs further investigation in:
- `shared_components/js/pricing-calculator.js` - Check the LTM fee calculation logic
- `shared_components/js/cap-embroidery-adapter.js` - Verify the pricing data includes LTM fee information

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Stitch Count Updates**:
   - Load a cap embroidery pricing page
   - Add quantities to different sizes
   - Change the stitch count dropdown
   - Verify that both the pricing grid AND the add to cart prices update

2. **Test Cart Display**:
   - Add items to cart with different stitch counts
   - Verify the success notification shows the stitch count (e.g., "cap embroidery (8,000 stitches)")
   - Check that the cart page displays the stitch count for each item

3. **Test LTM Fee**:
   - Add less than 24 items to cart
   - Verify the LTM fee shows the actual $50.00 amount, not $0.00

## Additional Considerations

1. **Cart Mixing Prevention**: The system should prevent mixing caps with different stitch counts in the same cart. This validation needs to be implemented in the cart integration.

2. **Product Title Validation**: Need to implement validation to check if the product title contains "Cap" and warn users if they're trying to use cap pricing for non-cap items.

3. **Pricing Data Structure**: The cap embroidery pricing uses a different data structure with stitch count as an additional dimension. This is handled by the `capEmbroideryMasterData` object.
