# Cap Embroidery - Front Logo Stitch Count Pricing Fix

## Issue
The front logo stitch count dropdown was not updating the pricing table automatically. The system should load different pricing matrices from Caspio for each stitch count (5k, 8k, 10k).

## Understanding the Pricing

### Front Logo Pricing (from Caspio)
- **5,000 stitches**: Has its own complete pricing matrix
- **8,000 stitches**: Has its own complete pricing matrix (default)
- **10,000 stitches**: Has its own complete pricing matrix
- The price difference is **built into the base price** from Caspio

### Back Logo Pricing (calculated)
- **Base**: $5.00 for 5,000 stitches
- **Additional**: $1.00 per 1,000 stitches over 5,000
- Examples:
  - 5,000 stitches = $5
  - 10,000 stitches = $10
  - 15,000 stitches = $15

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Stitch Count Change Handler
```javascript
function handleStitchCountChange() {
    const stitchCount = document.getElementById('stitch-count').value;
    state.frontLogoStitches = parseInt(stitchCount);
    updatePricingForStitchCount();
}
```

### 2. Update Pricing Based on Stitch Count
The system now:
- Checks for `window.capEmbroideryMasterData.allPriceProfiles[stitchCount]`
- Extracts the specific pricing tiers for that stitch count
- Updates the pricing table with new values
- Recalculates the quick quote pricing

### 3. Pricing Table Updates Automatically
When stitch count changes:
- The pricing table clears and rebuilds with new prices
- Each tier (24-47, 48-71, 72+) shows the price for the selected stitch count
- The quick quote calculator uses the new base prices

### 4. Fixed Pricing Breakdown
- Removed the incorrect "+$1.00" for 10,000 stitches
- Front logo now always shows "included" (price is in the base)
- Only back logo shows additional charges

## How It Works

1. **User selects stitch count** (5k, 8k, or 10k)
2. **System checks Caspio master data** for that stitch count's pricing profile
3. **Pricing tiers update** with new base prices
4. **Pricing table refreshes** showing new prices for all quantity tiers
5. **Quick quote recalculates** using the new base price

## Testing

1. Change stitch count dropdown from 8k to 5k
   - Pricing table should show lower prices
   - Quick quote should update immediately

2. Change stitch count to 10k
   - Pricing table should show higher prices
   - No "+$1" surcharge shown (it's built into base price)

3. Enable back logo
   - This still adds $1 per 1,000 stitches as expected

## Technical Details

The Caspio master data structure:
```javascript
window.capEmbroideryMasterData = {
    allPriceProfiles: {
        "5000": { OSFA: { "24-47": 22.00, "48-71": 21.00, "72+": 19.00 } },
        "8000": { OSFA: { "24-47": 24.00, "48-71": 23.00, "72+": 21.00 } },
        "10000": { OSFA: { "24-47": 25.00, "48-71": 24.00, "72+": 22.00 } }
    }
}
```

The beta page now properly uses this data structure to show different pricing for each stitch count option.
