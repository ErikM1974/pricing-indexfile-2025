# Phase 1 - Dead Cart Code Removal Summary

## Overview
As part of Phase 1 of the cap embroidery excellence plan, we've successfully removed dead cart code to transition to a quote-only workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Updates
- **Replaced**: `universal-cart-ui.css` → `universal-quantity-ui.css`
- **Created**: New `universal-quantity-ui.css` file that contains only quantity selection UI without cart-specific styles
- **Result**: Removed cart navigation, view cart buttons, and cart summary styles

### 2. JavaScript Configuration Updates

#### app-config.js
- Updated `STITCH_COUNT_MISMATCH_MODAL` messages to reference "quote" instead of "cart"
- Added feature flags:
  ```javascript
  CONFIG.FEATURES = {
      CART_ENABLED: false,
      QUOTE_MODE: true
  };
  ```

#### nwca-namespace.js
- Set `cartEnabled: false` in feature flags
- Marked cart API endpoints as deprecated:
  ```javascript
  // Cart endpoints - deprecated (quote-only workflow)
  cartSessions: '/api/cart-sessions',  // DEPRECATED
  cartItems: '/api/cart-items'          // DEPRECATED
  ```

### 3. HTML Updates (cap-embroidery-pricing.html)
- Replaced cart UI CSS with quantity UI CSS
- Added quote system scripts:
  - `quote-adapter-base.js`
  - `cap-embroidery-quote-adapter.js`
- Removed all commented cart script references

### 4. Controller Updates (cap-embroidery-controller-v2.js)
- Enhanced `CartManager.handleAddToCartEnhanced()` to handle quote requests
- Added comprehensive quote request modal functionality
- Converted "Add to Cart" buttons to "Request Quote" buttons
- Maintained backward compatibility while supporting quote-only workflow

## Files That Can Be Deleted (Dead Code)
These files are no longer needed and can be removed from the project:
1. `/shared_components/js/cart.js`
2. `/shared_components/js/cart-price-recalculator.js`
3. `/shared_components/js/cap-embroidery-cart-integration.js`
4. `/shared_components/js/unified-cart-adapter.js`
5. `/shared_components/js/cart-integration.js`
6. `/shared_components/js/add-to-cart.js` (should be converted to quote functionality)

## Files That Need Refactoring
1. **add-to-cart.js** → Should be refactored to `add-to-quote.js`
2. **pricing-pages.js** → Already skips cart loading, but could be cleaned up
3. **product-pricing-ui.js** → Remove cart-related comments and functions

## Testing
Created `test-dead-cart-code-removal.html` to verify:
- Cart global variables are removed
- Feature flags are correctly set
- Quote system components are loaded
- Cart CSS elements are not present
- Correct stylesheets are loaded

## Next Steps
1. Delete the identified dead code files
2. Refactor remaining files to remove cart references
3. Update any remaining UI text from "cart" to "quote"
4. Test the complete quote-only workflow

## Benefits
- Cleaner, more focused codebase
- No confusion between cart and quote workflows
- Improved performance (less code to load)
- Better alignment with business requirements (quote-only process)
