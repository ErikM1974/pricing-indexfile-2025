# Screen Print Pricing Fixes

## Issues Found

1. **Initial Pricing Not Displaying**
   - The adapter was receiving pricing data correctly
   - Prices were being extracted from tierData successfully  
   - BUT: No color count was selected initially, so no pricing was calculated
   - The message "No color count selected" appeared right after master bundle storage

2. **Data Flow Working Correctly**
   - Master bundle received: PC54 Navy with correct tier pricing
   - Tier extraction successful: 24-47 ($8.50), 48-71 ($7.00), 72+ ($5.50)
   - Price extraction from tierData working (added fallback logic)

3. **Caspio Error**
   - "window.dp8Block1Logic.initDp8MasterBundleFetch NOT FOUND"
   - This is from the Caspio footer expecting different code
   - BUT it doesn't affect pricing - data is still sent via postMessage

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Price Extraction (screenprint-adapter.js)
```javascript
// Added fallback to extract prices directly from tierData properties
if (!excludeKeys.includes(key)) {
    const value = parseFloat(tier[key]);
    if (!isNaN(value) && value > 0) {
        prices[key] = value;
    }
}
```

### 2. Delayed Processing (screenprint-adapter.js)
```javascript
// Added delayed processing after UI initialization
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('[ScreenPrintAdapter] Delayed processing to ensure UI is ready');
    processPricingData();
}, 500);
```

### 3. Default Color Selection (screenprint-integration.js)
```javascript
// Set default front colors to 1 if not set
const frontColors = document.getElementById('sp-front-colors');
if (frontColors && frontColors.value === '0') {
    frontColors.value = '1';
    calculator.updateColors('front', 1);
}
```

## Verification

The pricing should now:
1. Display immediately when page loads (default 1 color)
2. Update when colors/quantity change
3. Show correct tier pricing based on quantity

### Expected Pricing (PC54 Navy)
- 24-47 qty: $8.50/shirt base
- 48-71 qty: $7.00/shirt base  
- 72+ qty: $5.50/shirt base
- Setup: $30 per color
- LTM fee: $50 for orders under 48
