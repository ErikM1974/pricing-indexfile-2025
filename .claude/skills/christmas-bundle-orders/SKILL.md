name: Christmas Bundle Order Counter
description: Count and report on Christmas bundle orders (XMAS prefix AND Status='Processed' only). Includes day-of-week analysis.

# Christmas Bundle Order Counter Skill

This skill queries the Caspio database to retrieve and count Christmas bundle orders specifically.

## What This Skill Does

Fetches quote sessions from the database that meet BOTH criteria:
1. QuoteID starts with "XMAS"
2. Status = "Processed"

Provides:
- Total count of PROCESSED Christmas bundle orders only
- List of processed orders with key details (QuoteID, customer name, quantity, amount)
- Total revenue from processed Christmas bundles
- Total quantity of bundles in processed orders
- Breakdown by sales representative (Processed orders only)
- **Top selling products** by category (Jackets, Hoodies, Beanies, Gloves) with style numbers and percentages
- **Day-of-week analysis** showing which days receive the most orders with weekday vs weekend breakdown

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks questions like:
- "How many Christmas bundle orders do I have?"
- "Show me my Christmas bundle orders"
- "What's the status of holiday bundles?"
- "How many XMAS orders came in?"
- "Which sales rep has the most Christmas bundle orders?"
- "Show me Christmas bundles by sales rep"
- "What are the top selling products in Christmas bundles?"
- "What jacket/hoodie is selling best?"
- "Which jacket style is most popular?"
- "What day of the week do we get the most Christmas bundle orders?"
- "Which day is most popular for XMAS orders?"
- "Show me Christmas orders by day of week"

## Implementation

**Use this exact working code pattern to query and process Christmas bundle orders.**

### Step 1: Fetch Quote Sessions from API

```bash
# Save all quote sessions to a file
curl -s "https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/quote_sessions" -o /c/Users/erik/Downloads/quotes_full.json
```

### Step 2: Fetch Quote Items from API

```bash
# Save all quote items to analyze product selections
curl -s "https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/quote_items" -o /c/Users/erik/Downloads/all_items.json
```

### Step 3: Process Data with Python

```bash
cd /c/Users/erik/Downloads && python3 << 'PYEOF'
import json
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

# Load quote sessions
with open('quotes_full.json', 'r') as f:
    sessions = json.load(f)

# Load quote items
with open('all_items.json', 'r') as f:
    all_items = json.load(f)

# CRITICAL: Apply TWO filters (BOTH must be true)
processed_xmas = [
    order for order in sessions
    if order.get('QuoteID', '').startswith('XMAS')     # Filter 1: XMAS prefix
    and order.get('Status') == 'Processed'              # Filter 2: Processed status
]

print(f'Total Processed XMAS Orders: {len(processed_xmas)}')
print()

# Calculate totals
total_revenue = sum(float(order.get('TotalAmount', 0)) for order in processed_xmas)
total_quantity = sum(int(order.get('TotalQuantity', 0)) for order in processed_xmas)

print(f'Total Revenue: ${total_revenue:,.2f}')
print(f'Total Bundles: {total_quantity}')
print()

# Group by sales rep
by_rep = defaultdict(lambda: {'count': 0, 'revenue': 0, 'quantity': 0})

for order in processed_xmas:
    # Priority: SalesRepName, then SalesRep, then Unassigned
    rep = order.get('SalesRepName') or order.get('SalesRep') or 'Unassigned'
    by_rep[rep]['count'] += 1
    by_rep[rep]['revenue'] += float(order.get('TotalAmount', 0))
    by_rep[rep]['quantity'] += int(order.get('TotalQuantity', 0))

# Display sales rep breakdown
print('Sales Rep Breakdown:')
for rep in sorted(by_rep.keys(), key=lambda r: by_rep[r]['count'], reverse=True):
    stats = by_rep[rep]
    pct = (stats['count'] / len(processed_xmas) * 100) if processed_xmas else 0
    avg = stats['revenue'] / stats['count'] if stats['count'] > 0 else 0
    print(f"  {rep}: {stats['count']} orders ({pct:.0f}%) | ${stats['revenue']:,.2f} revenue | {stats['quantity']} bundles | Avg: ${avg:.2f}/order")

## Usage in Response

When responding to the user:

1. **Call the API** using the fetch pattern above
2. **Present the summary** with key statistics:
   - Total number of Christmas bundle orders
   - Total revenue
   - Total quantities
   - Breakdown by status
   - Breakdown by sales representative (count, revenue, quantity per rep)
3. **List recent orders** (limit to 10 most recent unless user asks for more)
4. **Format currency** with $ and 2 decimal places
5. **Include dates** in readable format (e.g., "January 15, 2025")
6. **Sort sales rep breakdown** by order count (highest first)

## Example Response Format

```
ðŸ“Š Christmas Bundle Order Summary (PROCESSED ONLY)

Total PROCESSED Orders: 20
Total Revenue: $5,712.00
Total Bundles: 80

Sales Rep Breakdown (Processed Orders Only):
ðŸ‘¤ Taneisha: 11 orders (55%) | $3,181.00 revenue | 44 bundles | Avg: $289.18/order
ðŸ‘¤ Nika: 9 orders (45%) | $2,531.00 revenue | 36 bundles | Avg: $281.22/order

Recent Processed Orders:
1. XMAS1020-1128 - Kelsie Stroud (Nika) - 4 bundles - $283.00 - Processed
2. XMAS1017-2560 - April M Edwards (Taneisha) - 4 bundles - $238.00 - Processed
[... continue list ...]

Note: This report ONLY includes orders with Status="Processed".
Archived and Open orders are excluded from all totals.
```

## Important Notes

- **CRITICAL: TWO-PART FILTER REQUIRED**
  1. QuoteID must start with "XMAS" (not BCA, not any other prefix)
  2. Status must equal "Processed" (not "Archived", not "Open")
  - **Both conditions must be true** - do not count orders that don't meet both criteria
- **Exclude Archived orders** - Even if they have XMAS prefix, if Status="Archived" they should NOT be counted
- **Exclude Open orders** - Even if they have XMAS prefix, if Status="Open" they should NOT be counted
- **Check QuoteID field** for the prefix, not other fields
- **Handle missing data gracefully** - Some fields may be null or empty strings
- **Always show currency with 2 decimals** - Format as $X,XXX.XX
- **Sort by date** - Most recent first when showing lists (use CreatedAt field)
- **Sales rep field priority**: Use `SalesRepName` first, fall back to `SalesRep`, then "Unassigned"
- **Use Bash tool with curl** to fetch the data from API
- **Count manually** from the JSON response or use simple grep/awk commands
- **Show percentages** when displaying sales rep breakdown to show distribution
- **Calculate averages**: Average order value, average bundles per order
