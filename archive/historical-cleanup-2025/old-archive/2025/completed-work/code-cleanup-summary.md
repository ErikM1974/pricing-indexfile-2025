# Code Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-01-20

### Overview
Performed a safe, non-breaking cleanup of the embroidery and cap pricing code to improve maintainability.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Cap Embroidery Pricing (cap-embroidery-pricing-v3.js)
- **Commented out 27 debug console.log statements** instead of removing them
- Preserved all error logging (console.error statements)
- Kept all functional comments and code structure
- Added note to deprecated fetchPricingData function about future removal

#### 2. Cap Master Bundle Integration (cap-master-bundle-integration.js)
- **Commented out 6 debug console.log statements**
- Maintained all functionality and error handling

#### 3. Embroidery Master Bundle Integration (embroidery-master-bundle-integration.js)
- **Commented out 6 debug console.log statements**
- Preserved all functional code

#### 4. Universal Header (universal-header.js)
- **Commented out initial 6 debug console.log statements**
- Kept error logging and warnings for debugging production issues
- Maintained the informational log for missing style search elements

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner console output** - Reduces noise in browser console during production use
2. **Easier debugging** - Can uncomment specific logs when needed
3. **Non-breaking changes** - All functionality remains intact
4. **Preserved error handling** - Important error messages still display

### Future Cleanup Opportunities
1. Remove the deprecated fetchPricingData function in cap-embroidery-pricing-v3.js (lines 980-1100)
2. Consider extracting common functionality between cap and embroidery pricing
3. Add JSDoc comments to main functions
4. Create a shared logging utility that can be toggled via configuration

### Testing Recommendation
Test both pricing pages to ensure:
- Pricing tables load correctly
- Master bundle data is processed
- No JavaScript errors in console
- All user interactions work as expected
