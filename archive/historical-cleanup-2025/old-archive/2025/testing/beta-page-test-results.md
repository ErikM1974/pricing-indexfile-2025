# Beta Cap Embroidery Page Test Results

## Test Summary

The beta page at `/cap-embroidery-pricing-integrated.html` has been tested and verified to work correctly.

## Test Results

### ✅ 1. Page Loads Pricing Data from Caspio
- The page successfully creates a Caspio iframe with the correct URL
- Pricing data is loaded asynchronously and processed correctly
- Event listeners properly handle the `pricingDataLoaded` event

### ✅ 2. Pricing Shows $24 for Quantity 24-47 (NOT $18)
- **FIXED**: The beta page correctly shows $24.00 for quantities 24-47
- The buggy `cap-embroidery-ltm-fix.js` file is NOT included
- Fallback pricing is correctly set: $24 for 24-47, $23 for 48-71, $21 for 72+

### ✅ 3. Stitch Count Dropdown Works
- The dropdown contains three options: 5,000, 8,000, and 10,000 stitches
- 8,000 stitches is selected by default
- The pricing updates when different stitch counts are selected

### ✅ 4. Back Logo Pricing Works
- The checkbox toggles the back logo details section
- Default back logo is 5,000 stitches at $5.00 per cap
- The increment/decrement buttons adjust stitches by 1,000
- Price calculates correctly at $1 per 1,000 stitches
- Range is properly limited to 5,000-15,000 stitches

### ✅ 5. Quick Quote Calculator Updates Instantly
- Quantity changes update pricing immediately
- The +/- buttons work correctly
- Quick select buttons (1 Dozen, 2 Dozen, etc.) update instantly
- Pricing breakdown shows all components clearly

### ✅ 6. Pricing Table Displays All Tiers Correctly
- The table properly shows the 24-47 tier (previously missing)
- All pricing tiers are displayed: 24-47, 48-71, 72+
- The fix for "72-9999" → "72+" label is working

## Key Differences from Original Page

### The Bug
The original `cap-embroidery-pricing.html` includes `cap-embroidery-ltm-fix.js` which contains:
```javascript
let basePrice = 18.00; // 24-47  ← WRONG!
```

### The Fix
The beta page excludes this file and uses correct pricing:
```javascript
if (state.quantity >= 72) {
    state.basePrice = 21;
} else if (state.quantity >= 48) {
    state.basePrice = 23;
} else {
    state.basePrice = 24;  // ← CORRECT!
}
```

## Console Errors
No JavaScript errors were found during testing.

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy the beta page** to replace the original cap-embroidery-pricing.html
2. **OR** Remove the `<script src="/shared_components/js/cap-embroidery-ltm-fix.js"></script>` line from the original page
3. Consider updating the cap-embroidery-ltm-fix.js file to use correct pricing if it's needed elsewhere
