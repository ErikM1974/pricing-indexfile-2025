# Cap Embroidery Beta Rollout Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines how to safely roll out the new cap embroidery pricing system using a beta button approach on the product page.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Product Page Changes

**File**: `product-updated.html` (or update `product.html` directly)

**What's Added**:
- A new "Cap Embroidery New System" button with a BETA badge
- The button sits alongside the existing "Cap Embroidery Pricing" button
- Users can choose which version to use

### 2. Visual Design

```
[ðŸ§¢ Cap Embroidery Pricing]  [ðŸ§¢ Cap Embroidery New System BETA]
         (Current)                    (New - with red badge)
```

**Beta Button Features**:
- Green tinted background to stand out
- Red "BETA" badge in corner
- Subtitle: "Try our updated version!"
- Same URL parameter handling as original

### 3. URL Structure

**Current**: `/pricing/cap-embroidery?StyleNumber=NE1000&COLOR=Black`
**Beta**: `/cap-embroidery-pricing-integrated.html?StyleNumber=NE1000&COLOR=Black`

Both use the same URL parameters, making switching seamless.

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **User Choice**
- Users can continue using the familiar system
- Adventurous users can try the new version
- Easy to compare both versions

### 2. **Risk Mitigation**
- No disruption to existing workflows
- Original system remains primary option
- Can gather feedback before full switch

### 3. **A/B Testing**
- Track which button users click
- Monitor completion rates
- Identify any issues with new system

### 4. **Gradual Adoption**
- Start with internal team testing
- Expand to trusted customers
- Eventually make new version primary

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Files (Week 1)
```bash
# Deploy the new integrated version
cap-embroidery-pricing-integrated.html

# Update product page (or deploy product-updated.html)

```

### Step 2: Internal Testing (Week 1-2)
- Team tests both versions
- Document any differences
- Fix critical issues

### Step 3: Soft Launch (Week 2-3)
- Enable for select customers
- Add analytics tracking
- Monitor for errors

### Step 4: Gather Feedback (Week 3-4)

- Track usage metrics
- Identify improvements

### Step 5: Iterate (Week 4-5)

- Improve based on feedback

### Step 6: Full Migration (Week 6+)
Once confident:
1. Make beta version the default
2. Move old version to "Classic" option
3. Eventually remove old version

## Tracking Success

   - Support tickets mentioning beta
   - Direct feedback emails

3. **Technical Metrics**

## Communication Plan

```

### 2. **In-Page Message** (Optional)
When users click beta, show:

- Mobile-friendly design
Your feedback helps us improve: [Feedback Button]
```

### 3. **Email to Key Customers**
```

We've rebuilt our cap embroidery pricing page for a better experience.
Look for the "BETA" button on the product page to try it out!

What's new:
- Faster page loads
- Fixed pricing calculations
- Better mobile experience
- Clearer price breakdowns
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Immediate**: Remove beta button from product page
2. **Next Day**: Fix critical issues
3. **Re-launch**: When issues resolved

```javascript
// Quick disable in product page
document.getElementById('cap-embroidery-beta').style.display = 'none';
```

## FAQ

**Q: What if users get confused by two buttons?**
A: The beta badge and description make it clear this is optional. Most users will stick with the familiar option.

**Q: How long should we run the beta?**
A: Minimum 2-4 weeks to gather meaningful data. Maximum 2-3 months before making a decision.

**Q: What if the beta has bugs?**
A: Users can always use the original. The beta label sets expectations that it might have issues.

**Q: Should we force some users to beta?**
A: No, keep it voluntary initially. Forced testing can be done later with a small percentage.

## Conclusion

This beta button approach provides the safest path to migrate users to the new system. It:
- Maintains the current system
- Allows real-world testing
- Gathers user feedback
- Enables data-driven decisions

The key is patience - let users adopt at their own pace while you perfect the new system.
