# Cap Embroidery Files Cleanup - June 17, 2025

## Purpose
This archive contains old/unused cap embroidery files that were cluttering the main directory and confusing development.

## Production File
The ONLY production cap embroidery pricing file is:
- `/cap-embroidery-pricing-integrated.html`

## Active JavaScript
The ONLY active cap embroidery JavaScript is:
- `/shared_components/js/cap-embroidery-pricing-v3.js`

## What Was Archived

### HTML Files (14 files)
- All mockup files (*-mockup.html)
- Old versions (v2, new, optimized)
- Backup files
- Test files

### JavaScript Files (9 files)
- cap-embroidery-back-logo-complete-fix.js
- cap-embroidery-back-logo.js
- cap-embroidery-controller-v2.js
- cap-embroidery-hero-breakdown.js
- cap-embroidery-ltm-fix.js
- cap-embroidery-pricing-simple.js
- cap-embroidery-quote-adapter.js
- cap-embroidery-validation.js
- cap-embroidery-pricing-fix.js

### Documentation (2 files)
- cap-embroidery-migration-plan.md
- cap-embroidery-pricing-refactor-plan.md

## Why These Were Archived
1. These files are NOT referenced by the production cap-embroidery-pricing-integrated.html
2. They represent old iterations, mockups, and experiments
3. They were causing confusion about which files were actually in use

## Cleanup Date
June 17, 2025

## Note
If you need any of these files, they are safely archived here. But for normal development, use only the production files listed above.
