# Embroidery Manual Calculator Test Results

## Test Date: Current

### Refactoring Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Converted all variables to instance properties
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Fixed input event handlers
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Created dynamic logo management system
- üîÑ Phase 4: Refactoring pricing display (in progress)
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: Updated all calculation methods
- ‚è≥ Phase 6: Clean up and test (pending)

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Variable Conversion**:
   - Changed all global variables to instance properties with `this.` prefix
   - Updated all method references to use instance properties
   - Fixed dual variable system that was preventing pricing updates

2. **Dynamic Logo Management**:
   - Implemented proper logo tracking with `additionalLogos` array
   - Added `logoIdMap` for efficient lookup
   - Created `syncLegacyProperties()` for backward compatibility
   - Enhanced location naming system

3. **Professional Slider Integration**:
   - Using EmbroideryCustomizationOptions component
   - Removed old manual slider code
   - Interface methods properly update instance properties

### Testing Instructions:

1. Open the manual embroidery calculator
2. Enter a blank cost (e.g., $6.00)
3. Adjust the front logo slider - pricing should update immediately
4. Add additional logos - pricing should update for each
5. Change quantity - all pricing should recalculate

### Expected Behavior:
- Front logo: 8,000 base stitches with ¬±$1.25/thousand adjustment
- Additional logos: Straight $1.25/thousand (no base)
- All sliders should update pricing in real-time
- Price breakdown should show all components correctly

### Next Steps:
- Complete Phase 4: Ensure pricing display uses all instance properties
- Clean up any remaining old code
- Comprehensive testing of all features
