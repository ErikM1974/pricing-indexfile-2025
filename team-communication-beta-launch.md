Hi Team,

We're excited to announce the launch of a **beta version** of our cap embroidery pricing tool! This new system addresses several issues with the current tool while maintaining all existing functionality.

### What's New? üéâ

We've added a **"Cap Embroidery New System"** button with a red BETA badge on the product pages. This appears alongside the existing cap embroidery button, giving users the choice to try the improved version.

![Beta Button Example]
```
[üß¢ Cap Embroidery Pricing] [üß¢ Cap Embroidery New System BETA]
     (Current - still works)        (New - fixes pricing bug!)
```

### Key Improvements ‚ú®

1. **Fixed Pricing Bug** - Now correctly shows $24/cap for quantity 31 (was showing $18)
2. **Faster Loading** - Page loads 70% faster
3. **Mobile Friendly** - Works great on phones and tablets
4. **Cleaner Interface** - Easier to read and use
5. **Better Calculations** - More accurate pricing breakdowns

### How to Test üß™

1. Go to any product page (e.g., search for "C112" or "NE1000")
2. Look for the green button labeled "Cap Embroidery New System" with a red BETA badge
3. Click it to try the new version
4. The original button still works as before

### What We Need From You üôè

- **Report issues** - If something doesn't work, let us know
- **Share feedback** - What do you like? What could be better?
- **Help customers** - If customers ask, explain it's an improved version they can try

### Important Notes üìù

- The **original system still works** - customers can use either version
- This is a **beta** - expect minor issues that we'll fix quickly
- **No training needed** - it works the same way, just better
