# DTG Pricing Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Element ID Mismatch**: The `dp5-helper.js` was looking for an element with ID `custom-pricing-grid`, but the `universal-pricing-grid.js` creates elements with different IDs (`pricing-grid-container-table`, etc.).

2. **Duplicate Event Processing**: The `pricingDataLoaded` event was being processed multiple times, causing performance issues and redundant operations.

3. **Excessive Console Logging**: Too many verbose console logs were cluttering the developer console.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Element ID Mismatch (dp5-helper.js)
- Added fallback logic to check multiple possible element IDs:
  - `custom-pricing-grid` (original)
  - `pricing-grid-container-table` (universal pricing grid)
  - `.pricing-grid` class selector (generic fallback)
- Updated header row and tbody lookups to handle universal pricing grid IDs

### 2. Added Event Deduplication
- Modified `dp5-helper.js` to only re-dispatch events when necessary
- Added check for `_dp5Processed` flag to prevent duplicate processing
- Existing deduplication in `dtg-integration.js` was already working correctly

### 3. Reduced Console Logging
- Removed verbose event detail logging in `dp5-helper.js`
- Removed debug logs for pricing data construction
- Disabled `testListenerReach` logging
- Removed test calls from `dtg-adapter.js`

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test-dtg-fixes.js` that:
1. Verifies pricing grid elements can be found
2. Checks event listener setup
3. Simulates pricing data events to verify deduplication

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- The "Custom pricing grid element not found" warning should no longer appear
- Pricing data events should only be processed once or twice (original + normalized)
- Console output should be significantly cleaner
- All pricing functionality should continue to work as expected
