# Art Invoice System Fixes Summary

## Date: June 30, 2025

### Issues Reported:
1. Invoice information not showing as invoiced in the application after creation
2. Can't find created invoices in application search
3. EmailJS is not connected (template ID: "art_invoice")

### Fixes Implemented:

#### 1. EmailJS Integration Fixed (art-invoice-creator.html)
- **Problem**: EmailJS template variables didn't match the email template expectations
- **Solution**: Updated email variable mapping to include all required fields:
  - Added `id_design`, `amount_art_billed`, `shopworks_references`
  - Mapped all customer information correctly
  - Added all required sales rep and company fields
  - Extracted ShopWorks references from notes field

#### 2. Enhanced Service Layer (art-invoice-service-v2.js)
- **Problem**: Insufficient logging for debugging art request updates
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout the update process
  - Added logging for art request lookup by ID_Design
  - Added logging for found art requests count
  - Added logging for successful/failed updates

#### 3. Fixed markInvoiceAsSent Function (art-invoice-service-v2.js)
- **Problem**: Function expected numeric PK_ID but received string InvoiceID (like "ART-52503")
- **Solution**: Added logic to convert InvoiceID to PK_ID when needed:
  ```javascript
  if (isNaN(id) && id.startsWith('ART-')) {
      const invoices = await this.getInvoices({ invoiceID: id });
      if (invoices.length > 0) {
          id = invoices[0].PK_ID;
      }
  }
  ```

#### 4. Enhanced Dashboard (art-invoices-dashboard.html)
- **Added**: Prominent refresh button in page header
- **Enhanced**: Refresh function with visual feedback
  - Shows loading state on buttons
  - Displays success notification
  - Logs refresh timestamp
- **Improved**: Search functionality to include ArtRequestID (ID_Design)
- **Added**: Console logging for better debugging

### Key Email Template Variables Fixed:
```javascript
// Now properly sends these variables to match template:
id_design: selectedRequest.ID_Design,
amount_art_billed: invoiceData.SubtotalAmount.toFixed(2),
shopworks_references: shopworksRefs.trim() || 'N/A',
customer_name: customerName,
customer_company: customerCompany || '',
customer_email: customerEmail,
customer_phone: customerPhone || '',
project_name: projectName || '',
artwork_description: artworkDescription || '',
time_spent: timeSpent.toFixed(2),
hourly_rate: hourlyRate.toFixed(2),
subtotal: subtotal.toFixed(2),
grand_total: grandTotal.toFixed(2),
notes: notes || '',
sales_rep_name: salesRepName,
sales_rep_email: salesRepEmail,
sales_rep_phone: '253-922-5793',
company_phone: '253-922-5793',
company_year: '1977',
artist_name: 'Steve Deland',
artist_email: 'art@nwcustomapparel.com'
```

### Next Steps:
1. Test the EmailJS integration with actual email sends
2. Verify that art requests are properly marked as invoiced in the database
3. Check that the search functionality now finds invoices by ID_Design
4. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues

### Debugging Tips:
- Check browser console for detailed logging
- Look for messages starting with `[ArtInvoiceServiceV2]` and `[Art Invoices]`
- The refresh button will show a success notification when data is updated
- Search by Design ID (e.g., "52503") should now work properly

### Auto-Refresh:
- Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- Manual refresh available via prominent button in header
- Refresh button shows loading state and success feedback

#### 5. Fixed Order_Type Display Issue (art-invoice-creator.html)
- **Problem**: Order_Type field displayed as "[object Object]" in preview modal and emails
- **Cause**: Database returns Order_Type as an object instead of a string value
- **Solution**: 
  - Created getOrderType() helper function to extract value from object
  - Updated all Order_Type references to use the helper function:
    - Invoice preview modal display
    - Art request listing display
    - EmailJS data preparation
  - Helper function checks for common object properties (value, name, text)
  - Falls back to "General" if unable to extract meaningful value
