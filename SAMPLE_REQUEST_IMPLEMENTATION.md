## Key Implementation Details

### Eligibility Rules
- Products with average price < $10 are eligible for free samples
- Using endpoint: `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/size-pricing?styleNumber=XXX`
- Caching results to minimize API calls

### Database Structure
- Using existing quote_sessions and quote_items tables
- Sample requests use prefix "SR" (e.g., SR1230-1)
- Status field set to "Sample Request"
- Price fields set to 0.00 (free samples)

### Sample Cart Features
- Maximum 3 samples per request
- Session storage for persistence
- Floating widget shows count
- Duplicate prevention
- Real-time eligibility checking

### API Integration
```javascript
// Check eligibility
GET /api/size-pricing?styleNumber=PC54

// Save sample request
POST /api/quote_sessions
{
  QuoteID: "SR1230-1",
  Status: "Sample Request",
  TotalAmount: 0,
  // ... other fields
}

POST /api/quote_items
