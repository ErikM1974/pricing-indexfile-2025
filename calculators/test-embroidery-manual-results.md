# Embroidery Manual Pricing Calculator - Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-01-31 (Updated: Current)

## Overview
Comprehensive programmatic testing has been implemented for the Manual Embroidery Pricing Calculator based on the patterns established in the MANUAL_CAP_EMBROIDERY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md documentation.

## Major Refactoring Completed

### Refactoring Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Converted all variables to instance properties
- ✅ Phase 2: Fixed input event handlers
- ✅ Phase 3: Created dynamic logo management system
- ✅ Phase 4: Refactoring pricing display (completed)
- ✅ Phase 5: Updated all calculation methods
- ✅ Phase 6: Clean up and test (completed)

### Additional Improvements Completed:
- ✅ Fixed rounding logic - Apply margin first (3.02 / 0.60), then CeilDollar
- ✅ Updated default blank cost to $0.00 with helpful placeholder
- ✅ Created beautiful glassmorphism pricing table UI
- ✅ Implemented dynamic additional logo rows without location names
- ✅ Added proper LTM fee display in table
- ✅ Created glassmorphism order summary card

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Variable Conversion**:
   - Changed all global variables to instance properties with `this.` prefix
   - Updated all method references to use instance properties
   - Fixed dual variable system that was preventing pricing updates

2. **Dynamic Logo Management**:
   - Implemented proper logo tracking with `additionalLogos` array
   - Added `logoIdMap` for efficient lookup
   - Created `syncLegacyProperties()` for backward compatibility
   - Enhanced location naming system

3. **Professional Slider Integration**:
   - Using EmbroideryCustomizationOptions component
   - Removed old manual slider code
   - Interface methods properly update instance properties

4. **Rounding Logic Correction**:
   - Now applies margin first: $3.02 / 0.60 = $5.033
   - Then applies CeilDollar rounding: $5.033 → $6.00
   - All pricing components remain unrounded until final sum

5. **Glassmorphism UI Implementation**:
   - Beautiful frosted glass effect pricing table
   - Clean, professional breakdown of all components
   - Dynamic additional logo rows (labeled as "Additional Logo 1", etc.)
   - Separate order summary card with glassmorphism styling

## Test File Created
`test-embroidery-manual.html` - A comprehensive test suite that includes:

### 1. API Tests
- ✅ API Response Status Check
- ✅ Decoration Method Validation ("EmbroideryShirts")
- ✅ Pricing Tiers Structure Validation
- ✅ Margin Denominator (0.6) Verification
- ✅ Rounding Method ("CeilDollar") Check

### 2. Pricing Calculation Tests
Test scenarios implemented based on the implementation plan:

| Scenario | Expected | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Basic Front Logo (24 qty, $3 blank, 10,200 stitches) | $35.00 | Tests base calculation with stitch adjustment |
| Front + 1 Additional Logo (24 qty, $3 blank, 8k/7k stitches) | $39.00 | Tests additional logo pricing |
| LTM Test (12 qty, $3 blank, 8,000 stitches) | $19.00 | Tests Less Than Minimum fee application |
| High Stitch Count (48 qty, $5 blank, 15,000 stitches) | $26.00 | Tests higher tier pricing |
| Maximum Stitches (24 qty, $3 blank, 20,000 stitches) | $50.00 | Tests maximum stitch count handling |

### 3. UI Interaction Tests
- ✅ Calculator Initialization Check
- ✅ Input Elements Existence Validation
- ✅ User Input Simulation
- ✅ Price Calculation on Input
- ✅ Additional Logo Toggle Functionality

### 4. Edge Case Tests
- Zero Quantity Handling
- Negative Blank Cost Prevention
- Minimum Stitches (1,000) Enforcement
- Maximum Stitches (20,000) Enforcement
- Large Quantity Handling (1000+)

## Key Pricing Formulas Verified (UPDATED)

### Front Logo Pricing
```javascript
// Base includes 8,000 stitches from API
const frontBaseCost = tier.BaseCost8k; // From API
const frontStitchAdjustment = (stitches - 8000) / 1000 * 1.25; // $1.25 per thousand
const frontEmbroideryTotal = frontBaseCost + frontStitchAdjustment; // NO ROUNDING
```

### Additional Logo Pricing (CORRECTED)
```javascript
// Straight $1.25 per thousand stitches - NO BASE FEE
const roundedStitches = Math.ceil(stitches / 1000) * 1000;
const logoCost = (roundedStitches / 1000) * 1.25; // NO ROUNDING
```

### Margin Application and Rounding (CORRECTED)
```javascript
// Apply margin FIRST (divide by 0.6 from API)
const markedUpBlank = blankCost / 0.6;
// THEN apply CeilDollar rounding
const garmentCost = Math.ceil(markedUpBlank);
```

### Final Pricing
```javascript
// Sum all components (garment + embroidery + additional logos)
const subtotal = garmentCost + frontEmbroideryTotal + additionalLogosTotal;
// Add LTM if under minimum
const finalPrice = subtotal + ltmPerUnit; // NO ADDITIONAL ROUNDING
```

## Integration Testing

### Calculator Features Tested:
1. **API Integration**: Successfully fetches live pricing data from Caspio
2. **Quote Service**: EmbroideryManualQuoteService properly initialized
3. **Interactive Sliders**: Update pricing in real-time
4. **Additional Logos**: Toggle sections expand/collapse correctly
5. **Pricing Breakdowns**: Show accurate component pricing
6. **Quote Generation**: Creates quotes with "EMBM" prefix

### Test Execution
The test file can be run by:
1. Opening `test-embroidery-manual.html` in a web browser
2. Tests run automatically on page load
3. Results display in organized sections
4. Success rate calculated and displayed

## Comparison with Cap Manual Calculator

The Embroidery Manual calculator follows the same patterns as the successful Cap Manual calculator with these key differences:

| Feature | Cap Manual | Embroidery Manual |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Max Stitches | 12,000 | 20,000 |
| Price per 1k Stitches | $1.00 | $1.25 |
| Quote Prefix | CAPM | EMBM |
| API Endpoint | method=CAP | method=EMB |
| Additional Logos | 3 (back, left, right) | 3 (logo 1, 2, 3) |

## Conclusion
The Manual Embroidery Pricing Calculator has been successfully implemented with comprehensive programmatic testing following the patterns established for the Cap Manual calculator. All core functionality has been verified through automated tests.
