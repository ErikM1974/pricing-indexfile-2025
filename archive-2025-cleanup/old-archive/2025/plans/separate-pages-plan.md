# Detailed Implementation Plan: Separate Pages for Pricing

Based on our discussion, I'll create a detailed plan for implementing separate pages for each pricing type with a simplified product context and tab-like navigation.

## Overview

We'll create dedicated pages for each pricing type:
1. Embroidery pricing page
2. Cap embroidery pricing page
3. DTG pricing page
4. Screen print pricing page
5. DTF pricing page

Each page will include:
- Simplified product context (small image, style number, selected color)
- Tab-like navigation to switch between pricing types
- "Back to Product" button
- Caspio embedded pricing calculator
- Additional information specific to that pricing method

## Implementation Steps

1. Update server.js with new routes for each pricing page
2. Create a shared CSS file (pricing-pages.css) for consistent styling
3. Create a shared JavaScript file (pricing-pages.js) for common functionality
4. Modify product.html to replace tabs with links to pricing pages
5. Create individual HTML files for each pricing type
6. Test all pages and navigation

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Each pricing type gets a dedicated page with focused content
   - Simplified product context provides necessary reference without distraction
   - Tab-like navigation allows easy switching between pricing types

2. **Better Performance**:
   - Only one Caspio iframe loads per page
   - No complex tab switching logic
   - Reduced JavaScript complexity

3. **Enhanced Content**:
   - Room for additional information about each pricing method
   - Space for FAQs and specifications
   - Better organization of related content

4. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Each pricing type is isolated in its own file
   - Shared CSS and JavaScript for consistency
   - Cleaner code structure

5. **Improved SEO**:
   - Dedicated URLs for each pricing type
   - Better content organization
   - More focused page content

## Next Steps

After approval of this plan, we'll proceed with implementation by:
1. Creating the server routes
2. Developing the shared CSS and JavaScript files
3. Building each individual pricing page
4. Updating the product page to link to these new pages
5. Testing the complete solution
