# Screen Print Quote Builder Summary Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing
**File Modified:** `quote-builders/screenprint-quote-builder.html`

---

## 🎯 Goal

Make the quote builder summary match the pricing page's detailed per-shirt breakdown, showing:
- Base price per shirt
- Small Batch Fee impact per shirt
- Final price per shirt (all fees included)

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (Old Display)
```
Products:
PC61 - Jet Black
30 pieces
$17.00/pc → $510.00

Quote Total:
Products Subtotal: $510.00
Setup Fees: $60.00
Small Batch Fee (30 pieces): $75.00  ← Separate line item
─────────────────────────────
GRAND TOTAL: $645.00

❌ Problem: Doesn't show per-shirt impact of LTM fee
❌ User has to do mental math to figure out $17.00 + $2.50 = $19.50/shirt
```

### After (New Display)
```
Products:
PC61 - Jet Black
30 pieces

💰 Per Shirt Pricing
─────────────────────────────
Base Price:                $17.00
Small Batch Fee Impact:    +$2.50  ← Shows per-shirt impact!
─────────────────────────────
Price per Shirt:           $19.50  ← Clear final price

Order Total: 30 × $19.50 = $585.00

Quote Total:
─────────────────────────────
Products Subtotal (includes Small Batch Fee): $585.00
Setup Fees (One-Time): $60.00
─────────────────────────────
GRAND TOTAL: $645.00

💡 Small Batch Fee Breakdown:
$75.00 total fee ÷ 30 shirts = $2.50 per shirt
This fee is included in the per-shirt prices shown above.
Order 73+ pieces to eliminate this fee!

✅ Clear: Shows exactly what customer pays per shirt
✅ Transparent: Explains how LTM fee is calculated
✅ Professional: Matches pricing page's excellent layout
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Added Per-Shirt Calculation (Lines 2677-2690)
```javascript
// Calculate LTM impact per shirt for detailed breakdown
const ltmImpactPerShirt = ltmFee > 0 && totalQuantity > 0
    ? ltmFee / totalQuantity
    : 0;

// Calculate products with LTM impact distributed
const productsWithLTM = productPricing.map(p => ({
    ...p,
    basePriceWithoutLTM: p.unitPrice,
    ltmImpact: ltmImpactPerShirt,
    finalUnitPrice: p.unitPrice + ltmImpactPerShirt,
    finalLineTotal: (p.unitPrice + ltmImpactPerShirt) * p.quantity
}));

const subtotalWithLTM = productsWithLTM.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.finalLineTotal, 0);
const grandTotal = subtotalWithLTM + setupFee;
```

### 2. Added Per-Shirt Pricing Breakdown Section (Lines 2727-2750)
New green-bordered box showing:
- Base Price (without LTM)
- Small Batch Fee Impact (per shirt)
- Final Price per Shirt
- Order Total calculation (quantity × final price)

**Conditional Display:**
- Shows detailed breakdown ONLY when LTM fee exists
- When no LTM fee (73+ pieces), shows simple pricing

### 3. Updated Quote Total Section (Lines 2834-2864)
Changes:
- **Subtotal label** now says "Products Subtotal (includes Small Batch Fee)" when LTM applies
- **Removed** separate "Small Batch Fee" line item (now included in subtotal)
- **Added** informational note explaining LTM calculation
- **Updated** setup fees label to say "Setup Fees (One-Time)"

### 4. Updated Stored Pricing Data (Lines 2868-2876)
```javascript
this.currentPricing = {
    totalQuantity,
    productPricing: productsWithLTM,  // Now includes LTM impact
    subtotal: subtotalWithLTM,        // Subtotal includes LTM distributed
    setupFee,
    ltmFee,
    ltmImpactPerShirt,                // New: per-shirt impact
    grandTotal
};
```

## 📐 Math Verification

### 30-Piece Example ($75 LTM Fee)
```
Base Price:       $17.00/shirt
LTM Impact:       $75.00 ÷ 30 = $2.50/shirt
─────────────────────────────────
Final Price:      $17.00 + $2.50 = $19.50/shirt

Extended:         30 × $19.50 = $585.00
Setup:            $60.00 (one-time)
─────────────────────────────────
Grand Total:      $585.00 + $60.00 = $645.00 ✅
```

### 48-Piece Example ($50 LTM Fee)
```
Base Price:       $14.00/shirt
LTM Impact:       $50.00 ÷ 48 = $1.04/shirt
─────────────────────────────────
Final Price:      $14.00 + $1.04 = $15.04/shirt

Extended:         48 × $15.04 = $722.00
Setup:            $60.00 (one-time)
─────────────────────────────────
Grand Total:      $722.00 + $60.00 = $782.00 ✅
```

### 73+ Pieces (No LTM Fee)
```
Base Price:       $12.00/shirt
LTM Impact:       $0.00 (no fee!)
─────────────────────────────────
Final Price:      $12.00/shirt

Extended:         73 × $12.00 = $876.00
Setup:            $60.00 (one-time)
─────────────────────────────────
Grand Total:      $876.00 + $60.00 = $936.00 ✅
```
