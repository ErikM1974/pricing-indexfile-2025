## SUMMARY
Major codebase cleanup and reorganization to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.
NO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES - Application logic remains unchanged.

## FILES DELETED (71+ orphaned/unused files)
- Removed duplicate JavaScript files (variations of same functionality)
- Deleted test files from root directory (moved to /tests/)
- Removed backup HTML files (replaced by Git version control)
- Archived old/unused calculator files
- Total reduction: ~16,616 lines of unnecessary code

## FILES MOVED (Better Organization)
From Root to Organized Folders:
- 6 data export files → /docs/data-exports/
- 2 template files → /docs/templates/
- 4 guide documents → /docs/guides/
- 4 log files → /logs/
- 1 script file → /scripts/
- Test files → /tests/
- Dashboard files → /dashboards/
- Quote builders → /quote-builders/

## NEW FEATURES ADDED
1. **File Monitoring System** (/scripts/safety-tools/)
   - safe-delete.js - Quarantines files instead of deleting
   - file-access-monitor.js - Tracks which files are actually used
   - dependency-mapper.js - Maps file relationships
   - comprehensive-test-suite.js - Tests all HTML pages
   - Environment-based: Set ENABLE_MONITORING=true to activate

2. **Safety Measures**
   - 90-day quarantine period for "deleted" files
   - Git-based recovery for all changes
   - Monitoring disabled by default (no production impact)

## CONFIGURATION CHANGES
1. **Removed Webpack** (package.json)
   - Deleted 18 unnecessary webpack dependencies
   - Simplified to basic Express server
   - No build process needed (static file serving)

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added patterns for test files
   - Added logs/ directory
   - Better backup file exclusions

## DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
1. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Added Pre-Flight Checklist
   - File Organization Enforcement rules
   - Root Directory Protection Rules
   - Common Pitfalls section
   - No Webpack warning

2. **ACTIVE_FILES.md**
   - Complete registry of all active files
   - Tracks purpose and dependencies
   - Documents files scheduled for removal
   - Update protocol for preventing orphaned code

3. **CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md** (New)
   - Comprehensive audit from Cline AI
   - Claude's reality-check comments
   - Practical recommendations for production system

## TESTING PERFORMED
✓ Server starts without errors (port 3001)
✓ Main pages accessible (/, /calculators/*, /quote-builders/*)
✓ DTG Quote Builder functional
✓ Art Invoice Creator functional
✓ No JavaScript console errors

## ROLLBACK PLAN
If issues arise after merge:
1. Quick revert: git reset --hard backup-main-before-cleanup
2. If already pushed: git revert -m 1 HEAD

## NOTES FOR TEAM
- This is primarily a cleanup operation
- No business logic changes
- All deleted files recoverable from Git history
- Monitoring system OFF by default
- Report any broken links or missing files immediately

## COMMIT HISTORY

- 81844ae: Major cleanup and simplification
- a2a4027: Complete major file organization cleanup
