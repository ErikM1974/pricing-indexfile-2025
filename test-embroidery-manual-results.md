# Manual Embroidery Calculator - Test Results

## Changes Made

### 1. Front Logo Pricing (Fixed)
**Before**: Basic calculation without stitch rounding
**After**: 
- Round stitches UP to next 1,000 (6,500 → 7,000)
- 8,000 base stitches = $0 adjustment
- ±$1.25 per thousand above/below 8,000

**Examples**:
- 5,000 stitches → 5,000 rounded → 8,000 - 5,000 = -3,000 → -$3.75 adjustment
- 6,500 stitches → 7,000 rounded → 8,000 - 7,000 = -1,000 → -$1.25 adjustment  
- 8,000 stitches → 8,000 rounded → 8,000 - 8,000 = 0 → $0.00 adjustment
- 10,200 stitches → 11,000 rounded → 11,000 - 8,000 = 3,000 → +$3.75 adjustment

### 2. Additional Logo Pricing (Fixed)
**Before**: $5 base fee + $1.25 per thousand over 5,000
**After**: Straight $1.25 per thousand (no base fee)

**Examples**:
- 5,000 stitches → 5,000 rounded → 5 × $1.25 = $6.25 ✓
- 6,000 stitches → 6,000 rounded → 6 × $1.25 = $7.50 ✓
- 6,500 stitches → 7,000 rounded → 7 × $1.25 = $8.75 ✓
- 7,000 stitches → 7,000 rounded → 7 × $1.25 = $8.75 ✓

### 3. Stitch Rounding (Implemented)
All stitch counts now round UP to next 1,000:
- 6,500 → 7,000
- 7,001 → 8,000  
- 8,999 → 9,000

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Order (24 qty, $3 blank, 8,000 front stitches)
- Front logo: 8,000 stitches → $0 adjustment (at base)
- Expected: Base tier cost + blank cost

### Scenario 2: High Stitch Front Logo (24 qty, $3 blank, 10,200 front stitches)
- Front logo: 10,200 → 11,000 rounded → +$3.75 adjustment
- Expected: Base cost + $3.75 extra

### Scenario 3: Additional Logo (24 qty, $3 blank, 8,000 front + 6,500 additional)
- Front logo: 8,000 stitches → $0 adjustment
- Additional logo: 6,500 → 7,000 rounded → $8.75
- Expected: Base cost + $8.75 for additional logo

### Scenario 4: Multiple Additional Logos
- Front: 8,000 stitches (base)
- Logo 1: 5,000 stitches → $6.25
- Logo 2: 7,000 stitches → $8.75
- Logo 3: 6,500 stitches → 7,000 rounded → $8.75
- Total additional: $6.25 + $8.75 + $8.75 = $23.75
