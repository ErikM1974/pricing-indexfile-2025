# HR / Staff-Dashboard Reorg — SweetProcess Library → 2 Categories (started 2026-07-10)

**Goal (Erik):** collapse the staff-dashboard sidebar to TWO knowledge categories — **Company Policies & Procedures** and **Training** — and disposition every document from the old SweetProcess HR system (2017–2026 export) into hub / training / retire. Collaborative, multi-session review project.

## Source & deliverables (all in OneDrive HR folder — NOT this repo)

Folder: `C:\Users\erik\OneDrive - Northwest Custom Apparel\2026\Human Resources 2026\NWCA Policy and Procedure list from Sweetprocess 2017 to 2026`

- **`_Dashboard_Migration_Worksheet.html`** — interactive review UI (verdict chips, filters, per-row Approve/Change/Discuss + notes → localStorage, CSV export, links to each doc). THE working surface for review sessions.
- **`_Dashboard_Migration_Worksheet.xlsx`** — same data, Summary + All Files (436 rows, autofilter).
- Prior art (May 2026 session): `_NWCA_Triage_Report.xlsx` (469 files, KEEP/UPDATE/CONSOLIDATE/ARCHIVE/DELETE + SECURITY tab), `_IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY.md`, `_HR_Policy_Dashboard.html`, `_Archived-Duplicates/` (50 files). Library was already cleaned/rewritten/consolidated then.

## Classification method (2026-07-10)

May triage verdicts + per-doc **content-overlap** vs the LIVE Policies Hub bodies (130 policies via `GET /api/policies-public/`) + fuzzy match vs `/training/` pages + ~70 hand corrections. Coverage tiers: ≥55% vocab overlap = COVERED, 35–55% = PARTIAL (merge-check), else gap.

**Result (436 active files):** PARTIAL-HUB 119 · COVERED-HUB 81 · RETIRE 64 · ARCHIVE 54 · HUB 47 (true policy gaps) · TRAINING 25 (true training gaps) · HR-CONFIDENTIAL 21 · RETIRE? 17 (dead-tool questions) · COVERED-TRAINING 8.

## Key facts discovered

- **Policies Hub already absorbed most of the corpus** (130 live policies incl. 22-chapter Employee Handbook, job descriptions, operator training). Don't re-migrate — the worksheet's COVERED/PARTIAL rows point at the exact hub `Policy_ID`.
- Hub API: public reads `caspio-pricing-proxy /api/policies-public/` (list at bare `/`, `/tree`, `/search?q=`); admin writes `server.js /api/crm-proxy/policies/*`.
- Dashboard nav lives in `staff-dashboard-v3/index.html` lines ~80–190: 6 sections (Company Policies → hub · Training 7 links · Office Assistant 5 links · Employee Bundles 4 customer pages · Inksoft Transform · Administration 8 admin-gated links).
- **HR-CONFIDENTIAL (21 docs)** incl. `logins-and-passwords`, comp breakdowns, named-employee reviews, interview questions — must NEVER go on the dashboard; SECURITY tab creds still need rotation.
- 17 RETIRE? docs hinge on dead-tool questions for Erik: Bigin, Salesforce/dataloader, Covideo, Mailbox Power, Wufoo, Stamps.com (ShipStation now), Jive phones, Mehar/Payoneer, Mailchimp nurture, 2023 PowerQuery scripts (superseded by pricing engine / Caspio CC app).

## Proposed 2-category design (pending Erik approval — do NOT implement before)

1. **📋 Company Policies & Procedures** → policies-hub (unchanged link; gains ~47 HUB-gap docs + merged PARTIAL detail over review sessions; Erik's Bonus Policy moves here from Office Assistant).
2. **📖 Training** → new Training Center index page under `/training/` with role tracks: Universal onboarding · CSR · Sales/AE · Office Assistant (absorbs 4 of the 5 Office Assistant guides) · Production/EMB · DTG · Shipping-Receiving · Accounting · Games/Quizzes · Reference.
3. Employee Bundles + Inksoft Transform → Quick Access tiles (tools, not documents). Administration → keep as admin-gated tools section OR fold API refs under Training>Technical Reference — Erik decides.

## Workflow per review session (suggested batch order)

RETIRE? → HR-CONFIDENTIAL → HUB → TRAINING → PARTIAL-HUB (by dept) → COVERED spot-checks → RETIRE/ARCHIVE confirm. Erik marks decisions in the worksheet; then: new hub policies via admin API (⚠️ CLAUDE.md two-way **Employee Handbook sync check** before publishing each), training imports as `/training/` pages, retire/archive moves files into `_Archived-Duplicates`-style folders.

## Wave 1 SHIPPED (2026-07-10 ~19:58) — 14/14 published, hub now 137 policies

- **7 PUT inserts:** pricing-negotiation (Special Pricing approval) · maintenance-equipment-care (Texwipe ordering) · dtg-daily-ops (3-2-1 + no-zinger) · emblem-orders-yung-ming (in-house printed emblems) · customer-complaint-handling (Fix-It Team) · jd-purchasing-clerk (performance expectations) · hb-13 (sick-overflow rule).
- **7 POST new:** `overtime-policy-2026` (⚠️ LEGALLY CORRECTED — unapproved OT is still PAID per WA/FLSA, discipline instead; old "not compensated" clause dropped) · `meetings-attendance-policy` · `screen-printing-outsourced-sop` (5 docs consolidated) · `production-manager-weekly-ops` · Training: `csr-90-day-onboarding` · `ae-sales-foundations` (SanMar U password REDACTED — rotate!) · `embroidery-quality-basics` (rewritten, not reprinted — © Stitches Mag).
- 10 more CORE sources VERIFIED already-covered → archive. CORE left = 8 (payment-terms merge, cc-auth fold, S&R training ×2, + 4 parked on Erik). PM-KPI eval rubric reclassified HR-CONFIDENTIAL.
- **Publish mechanics gotcha:** batched bash curl loop against the proxy stalls with empty responses — use sequential python urllib (publish_wave1.py pattern), 45s timeout, If-Match per PUT.
- **`/dashboards/policy-migration.html` tracker BUILT + verified** (dash-page pattern; data snapshot `policy-migration-data.json`, confidential rows excluded; nav: Administration → Policy Migration Tracker). Deploy **v2026.07.10.5 LIVE (Heroku r1618, Erik approved via question chip)**; tracker gated **admin-only** via `Staff_Page_Access` row (written through proxy `PUT /api/admin-rbac/pages` {page, allowedRoles, allowedEmails, description} + CRM secret — the GET-only `/api/staff-page-access` is just the reader). Erik is answering the 10 dead-tool questions next.

## Wave 8b — Org chart now CODED (Erik chose code over image)

Erik: "add the year as of July 2026" + "image or code it yourself?" → **recommended + built the coded version** (maintainability: roster changed twice in a year). `org-chart-2026` body = self-contained inline-styled HTML chart matching the PNG design ("AS OF JULY 2026" pill · Jim→Erik→5 directs · Production group box w/ Kanha+4 operators, Brian+Joseph, Mikalah, Sothea · dark-green Coverage panel). Coverage list appears ONCE (panel text is searchable). PNG kept as labeled "designed image version (July 2026 snapshot)" download link. **Next roster change = edit the policy HTML text, no image regen, no deploy.** Verified via structural render test (policy-detail.css + headless Chrome) before publishing.

**2026-07-14 UI refresh:** `org-chart-2026.js` now progressively converts that maintained Caspio markup into a scoped responsive chart (`org-chart-2026.css`). It adds member search, whole-production collapse, keyboard-operable department/team toggles, hover/focus hierarchy, print rules, and reduced-motion support. Other policies are unaffected because enhancement is gated to `?id=org-chart-2026`.

## Wave 8 — Official 2026 org chart image live (r1622)

Erik supplied the real chart (Downloads `organizational chart 2026.png`, 1426x1103). Uploaded via proxy `POST /api/image-uploads` (python multipart — bash `curl -F` returns EMPTY against the proxy, same stall family as wave-1 batch loop) → `api/files/bc31d977-f6b8-4609-99a9-98d296b28c7a` → **embedded in `org-chart-2026` policy + text CORRECTED from the chart**: Erik = **Operations Manager** (NOT COO), Jim = Founder/CEO semi-retired, **Mikalah Hede = Shipping & Receiving clerk** (Alicia out), Kanha = Assistant Supervisor/EMB, Sothea = Trim/QC/Pack, Joseph = DTG/Transfer/Laser op, EMB operators: Bunsereytheavy Hoeu · Sreyani Meang · Savy Som · Sorphorn Sorm, + coverage matrix (Erik↔Jim/Bradley · Kanha↔Ruthie · Joseph↔Brian · Ruth→Mikalah · Brian→Steve-Roland · Nika↔Taneisha). Dashboard: **"View Org Chart (2026)" link in the Team widget dropdown** (anchor variant of `team-dropdown__view-all` + components.css ?v bump). Also reachable: Policies Hub → HR, Training Center → orientation track.

## Wave 7 — Booklet-perfect handbook PDF (v2026.07.10.8, r1621, 28pp, ZERO ghost pages)

Erik's print review: no extra white space, logo on cover, clarity pass, 3-hole punch. Shipped: logo cover (Caspio CDN png, 262x143) + tagline + footer-free cover (titlePage) · left margin 1.4in for punching · intro's duplicate chapter list stripped (parent h2 is "Table of Contents", not "Chapters") · web-only "Related Policies" blocks stripped from ALL chapters · headings keepNext. **Ghost-page elimination loop:** footer-aware fill analyzer (exclude words below 90% page height — naive ymax is fooled by footers) → per-chapter COMPACT levels 1-4 in the generator (hb-09:1 hb-10:1 hb-12:2 hb-18:4) + two legit live hb-18 clarity edits (no-retaliation → protocol item 6; de-duplicated item 2 vs Reporting Hazards section — redundancy I'd introduced in wave 5). Result 33→28pp, every content page ≥32% fill. **Generator committed: `scripts/handbook-pdf/` (build_handbook_docx.js + README + logo)** — rerun after chapter edits; docx master in HR folder + Erik's Downloads (both names). Gotcha logged twice now: NEVER put backticked paths inside double-quoted `python -c` in bash — command substitution eats them (mangled ACTIVE_FILES rows again; fixed f7e94420).

## Wave 6 — Reading/print CSS + booklet PDF LIVE (v2026.07.10.7, r1620)

Erik: "best CSS possible... I want employees to use this" + printable booklet. Shipped: **policy-detail.css upgraded** (17px/1.75 on 74ch, Fraunces H2s w/ green bars, accent list markers, zebra tables) + **full @media print block → any of the 138 hub policies prints as a clean handout** (verified via headless-Chrome print-to-pdf + pymupdf render). **`forms/Employee-Handbook-Latest.pdf` regenerated: 33-page booklet from the LIVE 22 chapters** — cover, real TOC w/ page numbers, chapter page-breaks, numbered footers; includes the wave-5 compliance additions. **Repeatable pipeline: `build_handbook_docx.js` (docx-js + node-html-parser HTML→docx converter, fetches chapters from public API) → Word COM export (`TablesOfContents.Update()` + `ExportAsFixedFormat` 17)** — rerun after any chapter edit. Editable master → OneDrive `Human Resources 2026/Employee-Handbook-2026-07-10.docx` (+ copy in Erik's Downloads). Gotchas: Caspio auth embed hijacks anonymous headless loads of policy-detail (verify CSS via structural test page w/ real stylesheets+body instead); Read-tool PDF rendering needs poppler — use `pip install pymupdf`; TOC title must NOT be Heading1 (lists itself). **NEXT WAVE queue: standalone /training/*.html face-lift (embedded legacy styles), payment-terms merge, cc-auth fold, S&R training merge, retire-pile salvage read.**

## Wave 5 — Handbook compliance additions PUBLISHED (2026-07-10 ~21:14, 7/7 live-verified)

Erik approved the drafts + gave first-aid kit locations (**by the DTG printers + in the embroidery factory**). Published: PFML→hb-13 · WA Cares→hb-19 · injury/L&I + kit locations→hb-18 AND safety-emergency-procedures (compact mirror, cross-refs its Section 4) · pregnancy/lactation + disability/religious accommodations→hb-09 · pay transparency→onboarding-hiring-and-interviews · **handbook parent header now "last revised July 10, 2026" + change list**. Lactation space = "arranged with Erik" (no room designated). Handbook says annual January refresh w/ re-acknowledgment — these additions fold into that cycle. **`/forms/Employee-Handbook-Latest.pdf` snapshot now BEHIND the live chapters — regenerate when Erik asks.** Remaining ERIK: rotation + 2 credential docs (+ optional payroll/attorney double-check).

## Wave 4 — Handbook compliance DRAFTS delivered (2026-07-10)

**Erik answers:** retire-5 confirmed (RETIRE? pile now EMPTY — retire pile 132 total, still on disk pending the pre-delete salvage read) · SanMar rotation acknowledged-pending · **Qdigitizing login stays visible in emb-ops for operators (Erik call)**. Honesty disclosure given: ~60 docs personally read in full; all 436 machine content-compared + row-reviewed; May triage inherited; **commitment: full-read salvage pass over all 132 retire/archive docs BEFORE any physical deletion.**

**HR gap scan (evidence-based, live hub+handbook):** compliant already = sick accrual, 2x10min paid breaks (hb-12), meal waiver, final pay (hb-21), harassment (hb-10). **6 GAPS drafted → OneDrive `Human Resources 2026/Handbook_Compliance_Additions_DRAFT_2026-07.docx`** (ready-to-paste, per-section PASTE TARGET + reviewer notes): 1 PFML→hb-13 · 2 WA Cares→hb-19 · 3 injury reporting/L&I→hb-18+safety · 4 pregnancy/lactation (Healthy Starts, 15+ applies)→hb-09 · 5 disability/religious accommodation (WLAD 8+)→hb-09 · 6 pay transparency (EPOA 15+)→hub hiring policy. **NOT published — Erik reviews (fill-ins: first-aid kit locations, lactation room; verify PFML rate/cap + WA Cares 0.58%; counsel eyeball 1/4/5), then Claude publishes into chapters.** docx validator charmap errors = validator cp1252 quirk, file verified well-formed UTF-8.

## Wave 3 — Training Center + 2-category nav LIVE (v2026.07.10.6, Heroku r1619)

Erik approved OA-into-Training ("honest opinion" ask): **`/training/index.html` Training Center** = role-track directory (New-hire · CSR · AE · Production/EMB/DTG · S&R/Purchasing · Office Assistant · Games) linking static guides + hub policies, **plus a live "hub Training category" list from the public proxy API — new hub training modules appear with NO deploy (never add per-doc sidebar links again)**. Sidebar: Training gains "🎓 Training Center" landing link; **Office Assistant section REMOVED** (4 guides = OA track; Erik's Bonus Policy → hub `bonus-and-incentives`). Files: `training/{index.html,training-center.js,training-center.css}` (dash-shell tokens; /training is a PUBLIC mount — links/titles only). Remaining nav oddballs for later: Employee Bundles + Inksoft Transform (tools, likely → Quick Access).

## Wave 2 — Erik's Q&A cascade (2026-07-10 ~20:33, 4/4 live, hub = 138)

**Erik's answers (facts, durable):** phones = **GoTo Connect** (Jive sold; hub already said "formerly Jive") · **stamps.com STILL used** · **Bigin = Jim-only** (not an AE tool) · **Qdigitizing current** · Covideo/Mailbox Power/Wufoo/Salesforce DEAD · **Mailchimp heavily used** · EMB TAT still **2 weeks** · **Mixed Batch Fee RETIRED** (was folded into live pricing policy — bullet REMOVED; 25% difficult-order surcharge KEPT; code hits were false positives, `capEmbFeeRow` etc.) · 2026 roster: **Taneisha Clark AE in, Taylar Hanson out**.

Shipped: hb-17 Bigin dropped from systems list · pricing-negotiation MBF bullet cut · emb-ops "Delivery Time Commitment" (2wk + <1wk=rush) · NEW `org-chart-2026` (leadership named; full roster → live Team directory, so the chart can't go stale). 9 dead-tool docs → RETIRE. **SanMar creds (erik1974/go2shirt$$) scrubbed from source doc + May triage xlsx (8 cells) + worksheet — ROTATION still pending.** ⚠️ found: hub `embroidery-production-daily-ops` displays the **Qdigitizing login in plaintext** — flagged to Erik (don't redact unilaterally; operators may rely on it). ERIK tier now 7 rows (5 old one-offs + 2 credential docs); RETIRE? 15→5. Tracker data snapshot updated in repo — goes live NEXT deploy.

## TRUST MODE (2026-07-10) — Erik delegated curation

Erik: *"pick the ones that count … then the rest of the left over junk you can look at … I trust you Fable to do this."* Operating model now: **CORE 42** (HR 9 · Money 6 · Ops 15 · Training 12 — Fable updates each to 2026 standards and publishes; Erik spot-checks) · **ERIK 18** (dead-tool/credential facts only he knows) · **AUTO 376** (Fable processes; optional glance). Tier chips baked into the worksheet.

**Hub write path (working, verified):** proxy `PUT https://caspio-pricing-proxy…/api/policies/:policyId` with header `X-CRM-API-Secret` (value = `CRM_API_SECRET` in this repo's `.env`) + `If-Match: <Updated_At>`; send `Body_HTML` (Body_Plain auto-derived) + `Updated_By`. List endpoint omits Body_HTML — GET the detail endpoint first.

**LIVE hub fixes shipped 2026-07-10 (~19:35):**
1. `sales-tax-shopworks` — Milton 10.1%→**10.2%** (6.5+3.7), added **Tax_10.2 / 2200.102** (old 10.1/2200.101 marked retired), summary updated.
2. `eft-and-vendor-payments` — full **Kitsap Bank → Bank of America** rewrite (bill pay + check deposits; Payoneer section unchanged; Kitsap-specific "Deposit Connect" steps removed, Accounting owns current deposit method).
3. `credit-card-sop` — Translink funds settle → **Bank of America** general account.

**Business facts learned:** NWCA banks at **Bank of America** (July 2026; previously Kitsap Bank) — check `our-credit-references` doc + any vendor-credit references before reuse. **Translink IS current** (card-transaction view). Hub stale-scan (130 policies): pending-Erik markers = Jive ×2 (`phone-procedures`, `emergency-vendor-contacts`) · Stamps.com ×4 (`shipping-receiving-handbook`, `office-assistant-role`, `shipping-procedures`, `inksoft-and-shopify-workflows`) · Bigin in `hb-17-tech-data-security` · Qdigitizing ×7. 'sweetprocess' hits are cosmetic provenance text — **0 sweetprocess-hosted links in hub bodies** (nothing breaks at subscription end; only corpus-file attachments need rescue). `ltm-fee-policy` "10.1" = false positive ($10.17 example price).

## Status

- [x] 2026-07-10 — classification + worksheet delivered; nav design proposed; questions list sent to Erik.
- [x] 2026-07-10 — **Batch 1 reviewed** (Erik's first 15 marks: Accounting + Art + 2 CSR): 9 DISCUSS resolved via hub-body verification (5→COVERED-HUB archive, 2 merge-into-hub, CSR-90-day→TRAINING, sales-tax→fix-hub-first); his 4 RETIRE + 2 ARCHIVE safety-verified (hub artwork-intake names its consolidated sources verbatim; eft-and-vendor-payments contains full RDC procedure). Decisions read from Chrome Profile 2 leveldb (no CSV export needed) and now BAKED into worksheet data. **⚠️ LIVE HUB BUG found: `sales-tax-shopworks` still says Milton 10.1% — must update to 10.2%/Tax_10.2/2200.102 (Erik to paste corrected text or approve me doing it).** Gotcha: `credit-card-sop-2025` doc contains the FULL corporate card number in plaintext — redact before archiving.
- [ ] Erik reviews worksheet batches; answers dead-tool + nav questions.
- [ ] Implement nav (2 categories) + Training Center page after approval.
- [ ] Promote HUB-gap docs to hub (handbook sync check each) · import TRAINING docs · execute retire/archive.
