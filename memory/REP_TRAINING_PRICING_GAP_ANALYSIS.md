## THE BIG PICTURE: Where Money Is Being Lost

| Revenue Gap | Avg $ Lost Per Order | Frequency | Priority |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| **DECG underpricing** | $40-240/order | Every DECG order (~22 instances) | #1 CRITICAL |
| **LTM not applied (qty <=7)** | $50/order | ~40% of orders | #2 HIGH |
| **AL pricing inconsistent** | $1-3/pc (bulk = $90-400) | ~24 instances | #3 HIGH |
| **DD charged at $50 or $150** | $50/order | 2 of 16 DD orders | #4 MEDIUM |
| **GRT-50 overcharged** | $100/order | 1 instance | #5 LOW |
| **Empty part numbers** | Lost tracking | Multiple orders | #6 DATA |
| **Mixed decoration types** | Confusion | ~6 instances | #7 DATA |

**Estimated total revenue left on the table across 104 orders: $2,000-3,500**

---

## GAP #1: DECG (Customer-Supplied Garments) — BIGGEST LEAK

**Problem:** Reps charge $15-25/piece flat regardless of quantity. 2026 tiers are significantly higher, especially for small orders.

### 2026 DECG Tier Card (Garments):

| Qty | 2026 Price/pc | Plus LTM? |
|-----|--------------|-----------|
| 1-7 | **$28** | + $50 LTM split across pieces |
| 8-23 | **$26** | No |
| 24-47 | **$24** | No |
| 48-71 | **$22** | No |
| 72+ | **$20** | No |

### What reps charged vs what they should charge (all batches):

| Order | Customer | Rep | Qty | SW Price | Correct | $ Lost |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|----------|---------|--------|
| #136409 | Cintas | Nika | 20 | $15 | $26 | **$220** |
| #136449 | lululemon | Nika | 26 | $20 | $24 | **$104** |
| #136546 | Ikonika | Taylar | 10 | $20 | $26 | **$60** |
| #135303 | Tag Master NA | — | 29 | $20 | $24-28 | **$116-232** |
| #136515 | Gate Service | Nika | 4 | $25 | $28 | **$12** |
| #136520 | Tacoma Longshoremen | — | 4 | $20 | $28 | **$32** |
| #136496 | Troutlodge | — | 4 | $25 | $28 | **$12** |
| #135258 | PICK-QUICK | Taylar | 3 | $15 | $28 | **$39** |
| #136318 | UW Naval ROTC | — | 1 | $20 | $28 | **$8** |
| #136443 | MaxCare of WA | Taylar | 3 | $20 | $28 | **$24** |
| #136209 | (Batch 9) | — | 6 | $20 | $28 | **$48** |
| #136226 | (Batch 9) | — | 2 | $20 | $28 | **$16** |
| #136232 | lululemon | — | 1 | $20 | $28 | **$8** |
| #136513 | City of Unalaska | Taylar | 3 | $20 | $28 | **$24** |

**22 DECG instances across 13 batches. Estimated revenue lost: $800-1,500.**

**Special case:** Order #136526 (Roadmen Car Club) — $175 for 68K stitch full back jacket. This is correctly premium-priced for an extraordinary job. Not a typical DECG.

### When to Use DECG vs SanMar Products

**DECG = customer brings their own garments. We only do the embroidery service.**

Better for NWCA: sell the garment FROM SanMar + embroidery (higher margin on product + service).

**Use DECG only when:**
- Customer insists on their brand (Nike, Patagonia, lululemon, Carhartt)
- Item not available from SanMar (specialty uniforms, corporate-mandated brands)
- Corporate uniform requirements (Cintas, etc.)

**Upsell opportunity:** If customer asks "can you just embroider my shirts?" — check SanMar first. Offer an equivalent SanMar product + embroidery bundle. Many customers don't realize we can source similar products at competitive prices.

**Action for reps:** Use the 2026 DECG tier card. Never go below $20/pc even at 72+. Small DECG orders (1-7) should be $28/pc + LTM.

---

## GAP #2: LTM Fee ($50) Not Applied to Small Orders

**Problem:** In 2025, reps didn't consistently apply the $50 Less-Than-Minimum fee on orders with qty <=7. In 2026, the quote builder **automatically bakes LTM into per-piece prices** — reps don't need to remember it.

### Impact examples from batch data:

| Order | Qty | Without LTM | With LTM (2026) | Lost |
|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|------|
| #136443 | 3 DECG | $20/pc = $60 | $28 + $16.67 LTM = **$134** | **$74** |
| #136318 | 1 DECG | $20 | $28 + $50 LTM = **$78** | **$58** |
| #136441 | 8 garments | No LTM | +$6.25/pc LTM = **+$50** | **$50** |

**~40% of orders across all 13 batches were <=7 pieces** — that's roughly 42 orders missing $50 each = **$2,100 in LTM fees not collected.**

**Action for reps:** The 2026 quote builder handles this automatically. For manual ShopWorks quotes, add $50 to any embroidery order with <=7 pieces total.

---

## GAP #3: Digitizing (DD) — Pricing Errors

**Problem:** Two pricing errors found across 16 DD instances: one undercharge ($50) and one overcharge ($150).

### DD pricing across all batches:

| Rep | # of DD Charges | Price Charged | Correct? |
|-----|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Nika | 7 | $100 every time | YES — perfect |
| Taylar | 7 | $100 (5x), **$50 (1x)**, **$150 (1x)** | 71% correct |

**Specific errors:**
- Order #136114 (Taylar): DD at **$50** instead of $100 — lost $50
- Order #136526 (Taylar, Roadmen Car Club): DD at **$150** — $50 overcharge (unless justified as premium)

### Digitizing pricing rules (no exceptions):

| Code | Service | Price | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| DD / DGT-001 | New design digitized | **$100** | Customer sends artwork, we create stitch file |
| DDE | Design edit | **$50** | Modify existing digitized design |
| DDT / DGT-003 | Text-only design | **$50** | Simple text, no artwork conversion |
| DGT-002 | Design revision | **$50** | Customer requests changes to completed design |

**Rule:** If customer needs a NEW design digitized, it's $100 — no exceptions, no discounts. Edits/revisions are $50.

---

## GAP #4: AL (Additional Logo) — Wild Variance

**Problem:** AL pricing swings from $5 to $120 per piece with no clear tier logic. 24 AL instances found — some overbilled, most underbilled.

### 2026 AL tiers (garment):

| Qty | 2026 Price/pc |
|-----|--------------|
| 1-7 | **$10.00** |
| 8-23 | **$9.00** |
| 24-47 | **$8.00** |
| 48-71 | **$7.50** |
| 72+ | **$7.00** |

### What reps actually charged:

| Order | Customer | Rep | Qty | Charged | Correct | Issue |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|---------|---------|-------|
| #136386 | Holt Services | Nika | 200 | $5.00 | $7.00 | **$2/pc under = $400 lost** |
| #136126 | — | Nika | 60 | $5.50 | $7.00 | **$1.50/pc under = $90 lost** |
| #136420 | Art Morrison | Nika | 31 | $5.00 | $8.00 | **$3/pc under = $93 lost** |
| #136443 | MaxCare | Taylar | 6 | $8.50 | $10.00 | **$1.50/pc under = $9 lost** |
| #136257 | Little Wheels QMA | — | 2 | **$120.00** | $10.00 | **Overbilled or data entry error** |
| #136303 | City of Bonney Lake | — | 16 | $12.50 | $9.00 | Overbilled (complex back?) |
| #136318 | UW Naval ROTC | — | 1 | $20.00 | $10.00 | Overbilled |
| #136429 | CCNW Commercial | Taylar | 30 | $12.50 | $8.00 | Overbilled — likely Full Back, not AL |

**Key insight:** If the AL price seems too high (>$15/pc), it's probably a **Full Back** job — use DECG-FB instead of AL. Full Back has its own pricing (stitch-count-based), not AL tiers.

**Action for reps:** Use the 2026 AL tier card. Standard AL is $7-10/pc depending on qty. The $120 and $5 extremes are both wrong.

---

## GAP #5: GRT-50 Overcharging

**Problem:** One order charged $150 for GRT-50 (Patch Setup) — should be $50 flat.

| Order | Customer | Charged | Correct | Issue |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| #136554 | Cardinal Baths | **$150** | $50 | $100 overcharge |
| #136571 | Port of Seattle (Nika) | $50 | $50 | Correct |

### GRT pricing rules:

| Code | Service | Price | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| GRT-50 | Patch Setup / Logo Review | **$50 flat** | Logo placed on products — mockup + print review |
| GRT-75 | Graphic Design | **$75/hour** | Actual design work — creating/modifying artwork |

**Rule:** If customer needs a logo placed on products, that's GRT-50 ($50). If customer needs actual design/artwork creation, that's GRT-75 ($75/hr).

---

## GAP #6: Empty Part Numbers & Wrong Service Codes

**Problem:** Multiple orders have service items with empty part numbers or wrong codes. This breaks revenue tracking and confuses ShopWorks reporting.

### Examples:

| Order | Description | Issue |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| #136562 (Fire Buffs) | "Sew-on" with empty PN | Should be SEG |
| Multiple orders | "Transfer" / "EMB" / "Embroidery" as separator items | Should be in order notes, not line items |
| Batch 10-13 | Description-only items with pricing but no PN | Lost revenue tracking |

### Rule: EVERY service must have a part number

| Service | Part Number |
|---------|------------|
| Sewing (garment) | **SEG** |
| Sewing (cap) | **SECC** |
| Digitizing (new) | **DD** |
| Digitizing (revision) | **DGT-002** |
| Monogram | **Monogram** |
| Name embroidery | **NAME** |
| Weight | **WEIGHT** |
| Design transfer | **DT** |
| Contract (garment) | **CTR-GARMT** |
| Contract (cap) | **CTR-CAP** |

If you don't know the part number, check the Service Price Cheat Sheet or ask Erik.

---

## GAP #7: Mixed Decoration Types on EMB Orders

**Problem:** Some orders mix "Transfer" and "Embroidery" labels as line items on the same order.

### Examples:

| Order | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| #136554 (Cardinal Baths) | "Transfer" separator + embroidery items |
| #136557 (Cosco Fire) | "Embroidery" and "Transfer" labels mixed |

### Rules:
1. **One decoration type per ShopWorks order** — if customer needs embroidery AND transfers, create separate orders
2. **Don't use "Transfer" or "EMB" as line items** — these are separators/labels, not services. Put placement notes in ShopWorks order notes instead
3. Non-SanMar brands (Nike, Carhartt, Burnside) on EMB orders are fine — they're just DECG products that happen to be 3rd-party brands

---

## DATA ENTRY STANDARDS — Summary

Clean data entry means cleaner quotes, correct revenue tracking, and fewer manual fixes. The 2026 quote builder parses ShopWorks orders automatically — these rules help it work correctly.

### STOP doing these:
1. **Stop entering "Transfer" / "EMB" / "Embroidery" / person names as line items** — put placement info in the ShopWorks Notes field
2. **Stop leaving Part Number blank on priced items** — every service gets a code (see GAP #6 table above)
3. **Stop using lowercase state abbreviations** — always "WA" not "Wa", "OR" not "or"
4. **Stop mixing decoration types on one order** — separate orders for EMB vs Transfer vs DTG
5. **Stop entering AL when you mean Full Back** — if price is >$15/pc, it's Full Back (DECG-FB), not AL

### START doing these:
1. **Every service line item gets a part number** — reference the service code table in GAP #6 above
2. **Placement notes go in the ShopWorks Notes field**, not as blank line items
3. **Ship-to addresses**: `Company, Street, City, ST ZIP` — uppercase state, include ZIP
4. **One decoration type per order** — if customer needs EMB + Transfer, create two orders
5. **Design numbers**: `Design #:XXXXX - [description]` — complete, no trailing dash

### Pre-Submit Checklist:
- [ ] Every line item has a Part Number?
- [ ] No separator/label rows? (move to Notes)
- [ ] Ship-to address has uppercase state + ZIP?
- [ ] Correct service codes used? (not legacy aliases)
- [ ] One decoration type per order?

## WHAT'S WORKING (No Changes Needed)

| Service | All 13 Batches | Verdict |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Monogram/Name** | $12.50 every time (15+ instances) | PERFECT |
| **DGT-001 digitizing** | $100 (correct) | PERFECT |
| **Non-SanMar products** | Pass-through pricing (sell price override) | CORRECT |
| **Size upcharges** | $2/size step (2X, 3X, 4X) | CONSISTENT |
| **Cap bulk pricing** | $12-18 for 50-100+ qty | REASONABLE |
| **Sewing** | $10-12.50/pc (close to $10 target) | GOOD |

## REP-SPECIFIC COACHING

### Nika Lao (~60% of orders across all batches)

**Strengths:**
- DD always $100 (perfect across 7 instances)
- Consistent monogram pricing ($12.50)
- Good on premium/non-SanMar brand handling

**Weaknesses:**
- DECG at $15-25 flat (should use tiers) — biggest revenue leak
- AL wild variance ($5-120) — needs tier card on desk
- Some empty part numbers on service items

**Focus areas for training:**
1. DECG tier card — tape it next to monitor
2. AL tier card — same
3. Always use a part number for every service line item

### Taneisha Clark (inheriting Taylar's accounts)

**Taylar patterns Taneisha should learn from:**
- DD mostly $100 (correct 5 of 7) but had one at $50 and one at $150
- DECG closer to correct but still under for small qty ($15-20 for 1-10 pcs)
- Good monogram pricing, consistent size upcharges
- AL more consistent ($8-12.50) but sometimes too high (probably Full Back jobs)

**Focus areas for training:**
1. DD = $100 always (not $50, not $150)
2. DECG small qty (1-7) must be $28 — Taylar's accounts often had small DECG orders
3. Part number hygiene — every service gets a PN
4. When AL > $15/pc, check if it's actually Full Back (DECG-FB)
