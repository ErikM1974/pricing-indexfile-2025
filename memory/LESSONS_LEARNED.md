## A ratchet test sat red for 9 days because /deploy only runs test:parser (2026-07-28)

**Problem.** `tests/unit/builders-function-length.test.js` was failing on `develop`:
`dtg/form-core.js:init` measured 155 lines against a 150 cap. Nobody noticed for 9 days,
across several deploys.

**Root cause (two layers).**
1. *The regression.* Commit `b25c68ca` (2026-07-19, "fix(leads): quote-builder prefill from
   a lead now works") added the `?from=methodswitch` branch to DTG's `init()`, taking it
   127 → 155. The change was correctly synced to all 4 builders per Rule 8, but only DTG
   tipped over — DTG's `init` is the only one carrying every entry-mode branch inline
   (emb/scp/dtf equivalents sit at 133–146, just under the cap).
2. *Why it went unseen.* The `/deploy` skill's Step 0.6 smoke gate runs **`npm run
   test:parser`** — `tests/unit/parser` only. A red ratchet in `tests/unit/` does not block
   a deploy. `npm test` is the thing that catches it, and nothing runs it automatically.

**Solution.** Genuinely refactored rather than allowlisted. `init()` was a 5-way entry-mode
dispatcher, not the allowlist's justified case ("one cohesive HTML template", like
`form-core.js:render` at 383). Extracted `configureOrderSummaryBand()`,
`ensureRowsAndRender()`, and one predicate per entry mode (`tryDuplicateMode`, `tryEditMode`,
`tryQuickQuotePrefill`, `tryMethodSwitchPrefill`, `restoreOrStartFresh`) — each returns true
when it owns the load. `init()` is now 18 lines and the priority chain is explicit. DTG-only:
this is `init` dispatch, not one of Rule 8's sync categories.

**Prevention.**
- **Allowlisting a ratchet entry is almost always the wrong call.** It freezes the regression
  as acceptable and releases the pressure keeping the sibling builders at 133–146.
- The entry-mode ORDER is behavioral, not cosmetic (`?duplicate=` > `?edit=` > handoffs >
  auto-restore). Verify it with both params present, not one at a time — a one-at-a-time
  pass looks identical whether or not the priority survived.
- `adapter.js`'s JSDoc had already flagged this: *"the real split lands if init is ever
  unpacked."* When a file comment names a future refactor, that's the map — follow it.

## RBAC: an unlisted page defaults to OPEN, so half the Administration menu was public to staff (2026-07-28)

**Problem.** The staff dashboard's Administration menu held 18 links shown to every logged-in
staffer. Ten had a hard route gate (`requireCrmRole(['admin'])` / `requireCrmEmail`), but
eight did not — Blog Editor, SEO Strategy, API Usage, SanMar Payables, Commission Structure,
Bandit Integration, Policy Migration, Universal Records Admin. Any staffer could open them.
Two APIs were worse than the pages: `/api/crm-proxy/blog-posts*` (publishes to the PUBLIC
website) and the `/api/staff/sanmar-invoices/*` + `/api/staff/shopworks-payables` feeds were
only `requireStaff`.

**Root cause.** `gateStaffPage` resolves a page with no `Staff_Page_Access` row to *"any
logged-in staff"* (`if (!rule) return true`). That's the correct default for the ~100 ordinary
staff pages, and it's why the table-driven design is pleasant to use — but it means security
depends on someone **remembering** to add a Caspio row. Nothing in the code, the menu, or a
test said a row was missing. A forgotten row failed OPEN and looked identical to a deliberate
decision. The client had no role signal at all, so the menu rendered all 18 links for everyone.

**Solution.**
- Extracted the decision to `lib/page-access.js` (the `lib/cors-allowlist.js` precedent) and
  added `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PAGES` — the 18 Administration pages. For that set only, no row now
  means **admin-only** instead of any-staff. The Caspio table still wins, so widening is still
  a no-deploy edit in Access Admin.
- `gateStaffPage`'s error path used to fail open for everything; admin pages now fail closed.
- Gave the exposed APIs the same page/API-twin gate payroll already used:
  `requirePageAccess('blog-editor.html')` and `requirePageAccess('sanmar-payables.html')` —
  one Caspio row governs a page and its data, so they can't drift.
- Sidebar: `data-requires-role="admin"` + `hidden`, resolved by `nav-access-controller.js`.

**Prevention.**
- `tests/unit/admin-page-access.test.js` has a **drift lock**: it parses the Administration
  menu out of `staff-dashboard-v3/index.html` and fails if the menu and `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PAGES`
  disagree in *either* direction. A new admin page cannot land in the sidebar without an
  access rule behind it, and a retired one can't rot in the list.
- Rule of thumb: **gating a page is only half the job — gate the API that feeds it too.**
  A page gate stops the UI; only the API gate stops a direct request.

### Gotchas found while fixing this

- **`[hidden]` does not hide `.nav-section`.** `base.css` sets `.nav-section { display: flex }`,
  which outranks the UA `[hidden]` rule — the block stayed visible. Needs an explicit
  `[data-requires-role][hidden] { display: none !important; }`.
- **Hide is not enough — remove.** `command-palette-controller.js` harvests its Ctrl+K registry
  from the live DOM on every open. A merely-hidden admin link is still searchable by name.
- **Sidebar `aria-expanded` was decorative.** The markup shipped `aria-expanded="false"` and
  `toggleSection` never updated it, so screen readers were told every section was collapsed
  while open — and the `[aria-expanded="true"]` rule in `dashboard-v3-theme.css` never fired.
  Now synced in `sidebar-controller.js`.
- **New `.nav-section` headers render as a solid green square** unless they get a
  `data-section`-specific `mask-image` — `.nav-section-title > span[aria-hidden]:first-child`
  masks the emoji slot. Sub-group headers dodge this by having no leading icon span.
- **A backgrounded tab throttles CSS transitions.** With `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`
  a `max-height` transition never advances, so a timing-based UI assertion reads the START
  value forever and "fails" a perfectly correct stylesheet. Disable transitions in UI harnesses
  (`.qa-no-motion`) and force a reflow instead of sleeping.
- **A `max-height` collapse still reports a non-zero bounding box** for clipped children
  (`overflow: hidden`). Counting "visible" rows by height over-counts; walk up to the nearest
  collapsible ancestor and check its computed `max-height`.
