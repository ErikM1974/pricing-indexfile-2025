# NEXT SESSION PICKUP — set 2026-06-05 (Erik powering off)

## ✅ DONE THIS SESSION — deployed + verified, DON'T redo

### 1. ShopWorks receiving outage — FIXED + DEPLOYED + VERIFIED
- **Root cause:** the OnSite "Manage Orders" integration's **`APISource` filter = `ManageOrders`** silently
  dropped 100% of our blank-APISource pushes.
- **Fix:** stamp `APISource:"ManageOrders"` on EVERY push path. Deployed: proxy **v787** (EMB/SCP/DTF +
  order-form/3DT/DTG via `transformOrder`), Inksoft `transform.py` **v262**, frontend `server.js`
  (shipped in v2026.06.05.1).
- **Verified:** Erik's rep-built order **`EMB-2026-293` imported into ShopWorks** — `APISource:"ManageOrders"`,
  `id_Integration:200`, design #9449 linked.

### 2. AS-Garm subtotal fix — FIXED + DEPLOYED (frontend **v2026.06.05.1**) + VERIFIED
- **Bug:** EMB `SubtotalAmount` was saved as `pricingResults.subtotal + ltmFee`, which EXCLUDED the
  AS-Garm/AS-CAP stitch surcharges (they live in `grandTotal`, not `subtotal`), while `TaxAmount` + the
  pushed ShopWorks lines INCLUDED them → quote under-counted vs ShopWorks (291: $2493 vs $2605 lines).
- **Fix:** `shared_components/js/embroidery-quote-service.js` — BOTH save paths (saveQuote + updateQuote)
  now compute one shared `const preTaxSubtotal = grandTotal + art/design/rush/sample − discount` and use
  it for BOTH `SubtotalAmount` AND `TotalAmount` (can't diverge again). 40 jest tests pass.
- **Verified:** `EMB-2026-293` foots perfectly — Subtotal **$1142 = sum of all 9 lines** (incl the $312
  Additional-Logo fee); Total $1257.34 = Subtotal + Tax. (293's logo was ≤10K so it had no AS-Garm
  surcharge specifically — the AL fee folded in correctly; the jest tests cover the AS-Garm delta.)
- **TODO (carry-over):** add this to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (file was ~300 lines — archive an old resolved
  entry first). Lesson = "saved SubtotalAmount must equal the all-in pre-tax base the tax uses (= sum of
  pushed lines); never derive it from `pricingResults.subtotal` (products-only, drops stitch fees). Same
  'output paths must agree' class as the 2026-06-01 invoice bug."

## ✅ SHIPPED v2026.06.05.2 (Heroku v1237, commit c3123247) — 3 order-entry improvements; PENDING Erik's live-build verify

> **#1 AL qty auto-tally** — `embroidery-quote-builder.js`: new `getOrderPieceCounts()`; `addALLineItem`
> defaults qty to total garment/cap count (not 1); `syncALRows` auto-syncs it (now called from
> `recalculatePricing` so a garment-qty change flows in); `onServiceQtyChange` sets `alQtyAuto='false'`
> on manual edit; edit-reload sets `alQtyAuto='false'` to preserve the saved qty.
> **#2 logo card auto-collapse** — `updateLogoCardHeader` adds `.collapsed` once a Design # is set (chevron re-opens).
> **#3 one-click Push** — new `pushToShopWorks()` auto-saves via `saveAndGetLink({skipShareModal:true})` then
> opens the preview; button is now FIRST + prominent, enabled on Customer # (removed a dup legacy `pushToShopWorks` alias).
> AL still lands as a ShopWorks **LinesOE line item** (KNOWN_FEE_PNS has AL/AL-CAP/DECG-FB; `manualServiceItems` saves AL).
> **TO VERIFY (Erik builds an order):** AL qty auto-fills to the total + pushes as a line item with that qty; logo card collapses; one-click Push auto-saves then previews.

### Original feedback detail (now shipped)

### #1 (DO FIRST — pricing-safety BUG): Additional-Logo qty defaults to 1, should auto-tally to total pieces
- When a rep adds an **Additional Logo (AL)** from the Services bar, its qty defaults to **1**. It should
  default to the **total garment quantity** on the order (e.g. 39) and stay in sync as sizes change.
- **Risk:** if the rep forgets to change 1→39, the logo is under-billed ($8 vs $312) — Erik's #1 rule.
- **Where:** `shared_components/js/embroidery-quote-builder.js` — `addALLineItem` / the Services-bar onAdd
  handler. Set AL qty = sum of garment quantities (the "Total Pieces" value), and re-sync on garment qty
  change (in `recalculatePricing` or a qty-change hook).
- Erik's words: "it should default to the total quantity currently on the order… right now it sets the
  additional logo to one… thinking of a better, easier way to key this in." → answer: auto-tally, no manual count.

### #2 (UX): Logo card crowds the line items / hard to read
- The Primary Logo card is tall and sits ABOVE the product table, squeezing the line items into a tiny
  scroll area (worse with multiple logos).
- **Recommended fix:** auto-collapse the logo card to a one-line summary once a Design # is set (it already
  has the chevron / `toggleLogoCard`). Keeps it accessible but out of the way.
- **Where:** `quote-builders/embroidery-quote-builder.html` (logo-card markup) + `embroidery-quote-builder.js`
  (`toggleLogoCard` / the Design# set handler — `setDesignNumberOnLogo` / `updateLogoCardHeader`).

### #3 (UX — biggest workflow win): "Push to ShopWorks" is buried + Save-vs-Push flow confusing
- It's the LAST button under Copy/Print/Email/Save&Share. Erik got confused about what to click after
  entering the line items ("I think you have to click Save and Share… that option is buried").
- **Recommended fix:** make **Push to ShopWorks the prominent PRIMARY action** (top, full-width, distinct
  color) and have it **auto-save before pushing** (no separate Save step). One clear path: fill order →
  Push → review modal → confirm.
- **Where:** the right-panel action buttons in `quote-builders/embroidery-quote-builder.html` (Save & Share
  section + Copy/Print/Email/Push) + the push handler (`openPushPreview`/`confirmPushToShopWorks` — ensure
  it saves first).

## ⚠️ Flags + cleanup
- **`loadQuoteForEditing` froze the page** (90s+, twice) when I called it programmatically on complex
  quote 291 (DECG + multi-logo). May be my direct invocation (not the dashboard edit flow), OR a real
  edit-load hang on heavy quotes — worth a look; could bite reps editing big orders.
- **AUTOMATION NOTE:** the EMB builder is too heavy to drive reliably via Chrome CDP (freezes/races on the
  product autocomplete + edit-load). For live E2E tests, have ERIK build the order; I verify the pushed JSON.
- **Test orders to DELETE in ShopWorks/Caspio** (all test): `EMB-2026-293` (cust 1276 Aaberg's, Erik's
  test), `EMB-TEST-2026-291` (HAND-EDITED this session: SubtotalAmount forced to 2605, re-pushed, left
  `Status=Open` + `PushedToShopWorks` reset then re-set — re-lock or delete), `EMB-TEST-2026-294`,
  `VERIFY-1/2/3-0604`, `CTRLA/CTRLB-0604`; draft Caspio quotes `EMB-2026-294` / `EMB-2026-295`.
