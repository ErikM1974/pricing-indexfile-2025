## Slide 1: The Big Question

# "Where Are The Garments Coming From?"

**This is the ONLY question you need to ask to pick the right pricing tab.**

```
Is customer buying garments FROM NWCA in THIS order?
│
├─ YES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  ADD LOGO tab (blue)
│                                                                       Lower price - we have garment margin
│
└─ NO ─── Are they bringing their own items?
          │
          ├─ YES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  CUSTOMER-SUPPLIED tab (purple)
          │                                                             Highest price - no garment cushion
          │
          └─ NO ─── Wholesale partner with their own blanks?
                    │
                    └─ YES ──────────────────────────────────────────►  CONTRACT-RUTHIE tab (pink)
                                                                        Lowest price - partner pricing
```

### Quick Summary

| Tab | Who Uses It |
|-----|-------------|
| **Contract-Ruthie** | Wholesale partners, ad-specialty distributors who supply their own blanks |
| **Add Logo** | Retail customers buying garments FROM US in this order |
| **Customer-Supplied** | Retail customers bringing their OWN garments for embroidery |

---

## Slide 2: Quick Price Comparison

### Same Order: 24 pieces, 8,000 stitches, garments

| Tab | Who Uses It | Price/Piece | Why This Price |
|-----|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Contract-Ruthie** | Wholesale partners | **~$5** | Partner pricing, they supply blanks |
| **Add Logo** | Retail buying FROM US | **~$12.50** | We have garment margin cushion |
| **Customer-Supplied** | Retail bringing their own | **~$24** | No cushion, all risk on us |

### Visual Price Progression

```
Contract          Add Logo          Customer-Supplied
   $5      ───►     $12.50    ───►        $24

   │                  │                    │
   │                  │                    │
Partner          Our garments         Their garments
pricing          = we have margin     = we have ZERO margin
                 from the sale        embroidery carries ALL profit
```

### Why the Big Gap?

- **Add Logo to Customer-Supplied is nearly 2x the price**
- **Customer-Supplied to Contract is nearly 5x the price**

This is intentional! Customer-supplied work has no safety net - if we mess up their personal Carhartt jacket, we can't just grab another one off the shelf.

## Slide 3: Common Mistakes (With Dollar Impact)

### Mistake #1: "Repeat Customer" Confusion

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "They bought from us in June, use Add Logo" | "Are they buying garments TODAY? No? Use Customer-Supplied" |

**The Rule:** It doesn't matter if they're a great customer who bought $10,000 last month. If they're not buying garments FROM US in THIS order, it's Customer-Supplied.

**Cost of This Mistake:** $400-500 lost per order

---

### Mistake #2: Mixed Orders

**Scenario:** Customer buys 1 shirt from NWCA, brings 49 of their own

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| All 50 at Add Logo pricing | 1 shirt at Add Logo, 49 at Customer-Supplied |

**The Rule:** Only items purchased from NWCA in THIS order get Add Logo pricing.

**Cost of This Mistake:** $500+ lost per order

---

### Mistake #3: Forgetting Heavyweight Surcharge

**Scenario:** Quoting Carhartt jackets at regular price

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Standard DECG price | Add $10/piece for Carhartt, canvas, leather, bags |

**The Rule:** Heavy, thick, or difficult materials get +$10/piece (Customer-Supplied tab only)

**Cost of This Mistake:** $100+ lost per 10-piece order

---

### Annual Risk if Mispriced

| Issue | Est. Loss/Order | Monthly Orders | Annual Impact |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Add Logo instead of Customer-Supplied | $400-500 | 5-10 | $24,000-60,000 |
| Mixed order gaming | $300-500 | 2-5 | $7,200-30,000 |
| Heavyweight avoided | $100-200 | 3-8 | $3,600-19,200 |
| **Total Risk** | | | **$35,000-110,000/year** |

---

## Slide 4: Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

### The One Question That Matters

|-----|-------------|-----|
